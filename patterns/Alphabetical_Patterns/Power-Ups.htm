<H2>Power-Ups</H2>
<I>Power-Ups are game elements that give time-limited advantages to the player that picks them up.</I>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>The power pill in <I>Pac-Man</I> allows Pac-Man to hunt ghosts for a limited amount of time.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B> Quad damage <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Up</A> in <I>Quake</I> quadruples the damage caused by the player's weapons for a limited amount of time.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The possibilities regarding where the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producers</A> of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Ups</A> are and when <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Ups</A> appear are similar to those of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Pick-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Pick-Ups</A>. The main differences are that <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Ups</A> often give the player <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A>, and one has to determine how long the effect of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Up</A> lasts and if players can <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Trading.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Trading</A> them. However, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Ups</A> can also provide <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> such as temporarily raising <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Skills.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Skills</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Since the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Up</A> typically gives the player an advantage without a matching disadvantage, the use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Ups</A> may cause problems with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A> more easily than using plain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Pick-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Pick-Ups</A>.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Ups</A> share many of the consequences of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Pick-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Pick-Ups</A> but typically have a more transient effect. Since the effect has a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TimeLimits.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Time Limit</A>, picking up a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Up</A> can actually increase <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> if the usefulness of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Up</A> depends on the success of other goals, for example, using the quad damage <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Up</A> properly in <I>Quake</I> games efficiently depends on locating and hitting enemies first. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Ups</A> can be used as target objects for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainCompetence.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Competence</A> goals.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Ups</A> give players <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EphemeralGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ephemeral Goals</A> of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Collecting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Collecting</A> when they appear; knowing their location and when they are produced allows players to locate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A> and have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicKnowledge.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Knowledge</A>.</P>
