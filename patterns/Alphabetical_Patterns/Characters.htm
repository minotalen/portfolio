<H2>Characters</H2>
<I>Abstract representations of persons in a game.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Many games let players control game elements that represent people or creatures that act in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>. When these people or creatures have characteristics not directly shown in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> that can change during gameplay, these game elements have an abstract element called <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Roleplaying games let each player control a character, and one of the main types of achievement in the games is to raise the character's level, stats, or skills.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</I> is a first-person shooter where players have characters that can develop between levels by gaining experience points in various skills.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The design of use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> in games can either be on the level of creating explicit characters or by creating rules for how players can create their own <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A>. Independent of how <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> are created, the game designer can choose whether <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character Development</A> should be possible and if players should be able to affect it. Allowing players control over <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character Development</A> increases <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> as well as creates <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlannedCharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Planned Character Development</A>, which is a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investment</A>. This planning offers players the chance of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="VariedGameplay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Varied Gameplay</A> by making use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A> to instantiate potential <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OrthogonalUnitDifferentiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Orthogonal Unit Differentiation</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlannedCharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Planned Character Development</A> gives the possibility for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Development</A> in games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamPlay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Play</A>. However, unless games make use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMasters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Masters</A>, this kind of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> regarding <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> may be difficult to combine with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Creating complete <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> lets them fit within an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AlternativeReality.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alternative Reality</A> and allows personalized and unique <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A> for each <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character</A>. In games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combat.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combat</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goals between the players, pre-created <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> can be extensively play-tested to ensure <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A>. The use of pre-created <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> is common in games either where <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character Development</A> is not a large part of gameplay or where the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character</A>, and any <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character Development</A>, is closely tied to a tightly controlled <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Typical ways of letting players create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> are based around <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BudgetedActionPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Budgeted Action Points</A>. These are in turn used to determine the many various characteristics possible: the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handle</A> that identifies the character to other players; number values that represent physical or mental abilities or status of measurements such as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A>, health, and fatigue; <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Skills.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Skills</A> that affect the likelihood of succeeding with actions and may give <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> such as being a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer</A> that can create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A>; advantages, disadvantages, quirks, or other ways of describing character traits and motivating initial <I>Decreased Abilities, Improved Abilities</I>, or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A>; worldly possessions and equipment that represents <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A>; and occupations, social statuses, and social networks that define the characters place in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>. In games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A>, some of these characteristics are usually cosmetic. The variety of values associated with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> then open up for the range of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A>, such as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> through raised <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Skills.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Skills</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A>, such as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DecreasedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Decreased Abilities</A> through received <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A>, that can occur during gameplay.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">When players have rules for creating <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A>, this gives them <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CreativeControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Creative Control</A> depending on the level of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A> involved in the process, but this increases the possibilities for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Identification.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Identification</A> and<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Immersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Immersion</A> through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A> in all cases. The personalization possible also allows players to construct <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerDefinedGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Defined Goals</A> for their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> as they are created, and can give them the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionofInfluence.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusion of Influence</A> over how the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> will develop. However, with a larger amount of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> regarding the character creation process, the problem of fitting or adjusting the character to an integral role in a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> increases also. This problem can be mitigated by the presence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DedicatedGameFacilitators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dedicated Game Facilitators</A> that can perform <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Negotiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Negotiation</A> to make the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character</A> suitable to the planned events in the game or modify the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> to fit the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character</A>.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> provide games with points for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Identification.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Identification</A> and through these points <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A>, which can strengthen the impact of, and widen the range of, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> usable in the game, especially in the case of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PersistentGameWorlds.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Persistent Game Worlds</A>. The presence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> also allows more detailed <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> and richer <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> where social relationships and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character Development</A> can be important components. This is especially true in cases where <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Roleplaying.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Roleplaying</A> the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A> about the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> is possible.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">In games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Worlds</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> form links between abstract game state values and concrete game state values through their connection to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A>. When no concrete <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> exists, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> take the role of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> in replacement of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">In <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="MultiplayerGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Multiplayer Games</A>, having <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> with different <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> allows <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OrthogonalUnitDifferentiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Orthogonal Unit Differentiation</A> and lets players specialize in different <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CompetenceAreas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competence Areas</A>. However, the differences in abilities may cause <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A> to be disrupted.</P>
