<H2>Damage</H2>
<I>Effects from actions or events that can lead to negative consequences.</I>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> is an indication that players have failed to avoid the actions of enemies or dangerous objects in the game. The effects of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> in most games are minor; it is mainly used as an indicator of how many times one may fail in a certain manor before more serious effects occur.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Few first-person shooters make all hits instantaneous kills. Rather they require players to succeed with shots or strikes several times, each one giving <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A>, before killing their opponents.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Roleplaying games often have detailed rules for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A>, dividing character's bodies into different hit areas and having different consequences for taking <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> in each area.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>In the board game <I>RoboRally</I> the first points of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> reduced the number of cards received each round. However, more <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> makes some cards be repeated each turn and severely limit the possible actions each turn. Even more <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> destroys the robot.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">Designing a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> effect consists of determining what type of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> is caused, how the severity of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> is calculated, how much accumulated <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> is needed before additional effects take place, if players can affect the severity of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A>, and if <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damages</A> can be healed or repaired. If the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> comes as an effect of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprise</A>, the severity of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprise</A> is increased but players <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionofInfluence.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusion of Influence</A> may be negatively affected.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The most common type of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> is simply a reduction of a health, hit points, or armor <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource</A>. Additional effects such as forced <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Downtime.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Downtime</A> and reduced <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Skills.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Skills</A>, or other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AbilityLosses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ability Losses</A>, can be used to create other types of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A>, but these are often reserved for special hits. Independent of how the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> was caused its numerical values can either be fixed or be determined by a function. Fixed <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> values give <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A> while function can be used to create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A> and increase the potential interest for each time <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> is received.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> allows modulation of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Eliminate.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Eliminate</A> goals so that not one single successful attack eliminates an opponent but rather several successes are required. How much <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> can be received before more severe <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> are inflicted modulates the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices player do when determining if the risk of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> is worth the potential <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A>. Giving different <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> different values for this breakpoint can be one dimension in creating <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OrthogonalUnitDifferentiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Orthogonal Unit Differentiation</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Modulating damage by affecting where it is given can allow players to have an influence of the severity of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A>. An example of this is the possibility to do instantaneous kills with head shots in many first-person shooters. If it is not obvious where to hit to inflict greater damage, this area is an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Achilles'Heels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Achilles' Heels</A> and the information is <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicKnowledge.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Knowledge</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Player may also diminish or cancel the amount of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> they receive by counter or pre-emptive actions. Examples of counter actions include using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> (most common in games with the special effect as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Cards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cards</A>) or performing blocking or parrying maneuvers. Examples of pre-emptive actions include gaining invulnerability or armor, both usually received as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Ups</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Pick-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Pick-Ups</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The amount of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> received is usually indicated by a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StatusIndicators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Status Indicator</A> in order for players to perceive the severity of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> and gain knowledge about what caused the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">If <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damages</A> can be healed or repaired, they can make <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> such as health or armor into <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A>. The actual effect of healing or repairing offers the same design choices as for other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A>.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The possibility of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> in games gives <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> is a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A> and usually has very <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A>. The cause for receiving <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> is the most often due to failing to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> the effects of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DeadlyTraps.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Deadly Traps</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combat.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combat</A>. Less common reasons for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> include not being the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="KingoftheHill.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">King of the Hill</A> or making a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Consumers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consumer</A> perform actionswhere the resources used are described in terms of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Like <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> can be seen as a measure of how many times one may fail avoiding bad effects in a game before a more severe <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A> is imposed. However, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> works on a smaller scale and may have no effect on player's <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> until the accumulated <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> is translated into another form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A>, typically loss of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> or the destruction of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Unit</A>. When <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> gives immediate effects, the most common types of effects are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AbilityLosses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ability Loss</A>, forced <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Downtime.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Downtime</A>, or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DisruptionofFocusedAttention.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Disruption of Focused Attention</A>.</P>
