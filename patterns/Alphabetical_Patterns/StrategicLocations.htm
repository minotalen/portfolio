<H2>Strategic Locations</H2>
<I>Strategic Locations are areas in the Game World that give an advantage to the players controlling them.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Their value can be that they contain game elements that allow certain actions or resources unavailable elsewhere, or that they control the access to other areas of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>The player who controls the center of the game board in <I>Chess</I>, especially with officers, has a significant strategic advantage.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Controlling locations that produce valuable resources, such as the cities in <I>Civilization</I>, provide the player a long-term strategic advantage.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A> may be either explicit by the presence of game elements or implicit deriving from the relationship between the location and other locations in the game. Explicit <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A> can easily be created by the placement of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceGenerators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Generators</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Locations</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Chargers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Chargers</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tiles</A>,<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Pick-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Pick-Ups</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Ups</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Controllers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Controllers</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SafeHavens.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Safe Havens</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpawnPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawn Points</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GoalPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Goal Points</A>. To ensure players' awareness of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A>, they can be set to stand out in the visual design of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OutstandingFeatures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Outstanding Features</A>. Implicit <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A> may be intentionally created by the arrangement of explicit <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A> nearby, or they may be emergent features due to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A> of<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource</A> allocation or due to the combinations of player strategies. In either case, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A> can affect <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A>, typically by giving advantages in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combat.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combat</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Games using player constructed boards from <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tiles</A> allow the players to modify the value of explicit <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A> by placing them in positions where their relationship to other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tiles</A> increase or decrease their usability. Similarly, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tiles</A> with no inherent value can be made <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A> by connecting them to other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tiles</A> in a certain way.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">A player might <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Information</A> about <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A> as a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SupportingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Supporting Goal</A> with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Traverse.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Traverse</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Guard.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Guard</A>, or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Reconnaissance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reconnaissance</A>. It can be the primary subgoal in goals of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A>. Knowing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A> can also influence <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A>, if players have control over which <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpawnPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawn Points</A> to use.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text">Knowing and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Memorizing.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Memorizing</A> the proper value and use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A> is one way for the players to gain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicKnowledge.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Knowledge</A> in a game, for example, in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Traverse.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Traverse</A> goals. This is especially true for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A> that depend mainly on the topology of the surrounding <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> for their values, rather than on the explicit presence of valuable game elements. An example of how topology dictates that value of a location is the value of the central area of the board in <I>Chess</I>. If the locations can be owned in the game, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A> make excellent <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> goals that can be achieved through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AreaControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Area Control</A> or other actions that provide <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> of parts of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>.</P>
