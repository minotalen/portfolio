<H2>Units</H2>
<I>Units are groups of game elements under the player's control that let the player perform actions to influence the Game World.</I>
<P CLASS="text">The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> can have different actions and attributes associated with them. As a single player controls several <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>, the loss of a single <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Unit</A> may not determine the final outcome of a game.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Real-time strategy games make heavy use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>, where the choice and use of the different available types of units is one of the strategic skills of the games.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>Pik-Min</I>, a more or less real-time puzzle game, and <I>Lemmings</I> are examples of games that make heavy use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>, which in these cases are only partly under the player's direct control</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>All the pieces in <I>Chess</I> except the king are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>In the board game <I>Space Hulk</I>, one of the players controls an essentially unlimited amount of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>, called genestealers, which are replenished endlessly. The opposing player has a preset number of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>, called space marines, which are not replenished once lost.</P>

<P CLASS="text"></P>
<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">Several design choices have to be made when using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>. The amount of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> available to the players is one of the most fundamental choices. The number of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> may be preset so that the players have<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Resources</A> or it may be determined by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A>, or depending on the player actions, during the set-up phase. When the players can affect the number of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> they may have during the gameplay, these <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A> and can be rewards for completing subgoals or be produced from <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceGenerators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Generators</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Converters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Converters</A> that are under the player's control. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> themselves may be part of a neutral pool of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>, which the player can take control over. In most cases, the lifetime of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> is governed by a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumer</A> pattern. For example in <I>Civilization</I>, the production of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> is done in cities, and the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> can be consumed in battle. Control of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producers</A> may allow players to gain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A> for their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>, as may <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> of enemy <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Beyond how many <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> are available to players is the decision of when the players can start to use them. Making all possible <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> available at the start makes them a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Non-RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Non-Renewable Resource</A> and typically speeds up the game if they can be eliminated during gameplay. Portioning the available <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> over time or giving them out as rewards for goals can be used to maintain the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofComplexity.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Complexity</A> and avoid <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AnalysisParalysis.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Analysis Paralysis</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The abilities of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> can either be identical---in order to stress the use of them as a group---or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AsymmetricAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Asymmetric Abilities</A> offering <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OrthogonalUnitDifferentiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Orthogonal Unit Differentiation</A> can be used to provide different <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> for different <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>. In the latter case, this can increase the value of each <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Unit</A> as it may not be replaced by another and may promote <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A> on when and where to use uncommon <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OrthogonalUnitDifferentiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Orthogonal Unit Differentiation</A> between <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> under the control of different players may set up <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Paper-Rock-Scissors.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Paper-Rock-Scissors</A> power relations. If the players can control the production of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>, the existence of several different types can promote <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="VariedGameplay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Varied Gameplay</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tradeoffs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tradeoffs</A>, as the players have to decide what types of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> they want to acquire.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Naturally, game elements that are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> cannot also be <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A>. However, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> can be used as companions to the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A>; in this case, they can be given various degrees of autonomy or be directly controlled by the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatar</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Providing players with sufficient information about the current state of the<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> can require the use of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameStateOverview.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game State Overview</A> or a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> that they can view in its entirety. Many games using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>, and especially those where the number of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> can change over time, make use of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Cameras.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Camera</A> for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Third-PersonViews.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Third-Person View</A> and a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="God'sFinger.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">God's Finger</A> to allow the players to navigate the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> in order to locate and select which <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> to use.</P>

<P CLASS="text"></P>
<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> are a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource</A> in games, and often acquiring them represents a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investment</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> allow the players to have multiple<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> where they can affect the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> without affecting <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ConsistentRealityLogic.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consistent Reality Logic</A>. However, this may make it difficult to attain the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofComplexity.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Complexity</A> due to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AttentionSwapping.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Attention Swapping</A>. This is especially likely if the game does not support a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameStateOverview.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game State Overview</A>, which shows relevant information about each player's <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> are often targets of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damages</A> from <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DeadlyTraps.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Deadly Traps</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combat.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combat</A> motivated by other players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Eliminate.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Eliminate</A> goals, resulting either in the destruction of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> or in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DecreasedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Decreased Abilities</A> of those <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> of losing the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> are often <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AbilityLosses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ability Losses</A>, and the player controlling the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> may have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Survive.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Survive</A> goals.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Various <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> can have different <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedSetofActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Set of Actions</A> by making use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OrthogonalUnitDifferentiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Orthogonal Unit Differentiation</A>, so using them can require the players to make <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tradeoffs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tradeoffs</A> between different types of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>. Performing the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AttentionSwapping.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Attention Swapping</A> between <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> is most commonly enabled by another <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A>, a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="God'sFinger.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">God's Finger</A>. Different stages of the gameplay can further require different types of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>, allowing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="VariedGameplay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Varied Gameplay</A>. The different abilities of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> do not have to be inherent; the use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A> can explain various <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> let the players simulate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamPlay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Play</A> so they can set up complex actions as well as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExtendedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extended Actions</A> by coordinating the individual actions of several <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>. This allows <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A> and allows the players to do <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> on a higher level than using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A>, as the destruction or death of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> may in some cases even be advantageous and necessary. Thus <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> can be seen as a use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ParallelLives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Parallel Lives</A> which in contrast to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A> are more or less dispensable.</P>
