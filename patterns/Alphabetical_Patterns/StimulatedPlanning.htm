<H2>Stimulated Planning</H2>
<I>Games that encourage players to plan about certain aspects of the game.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Some games provide players with the opportunity to know with some certainty the outcomes of actions and thereby be able to plan what to do thereafter. The certainty of the outcomes and the number of possible future game states after a couple of actions decide if these games can be said to encourage <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A> amongst players.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Real-time strategy games that provide different types of units and special abilities encourage players to plan how they are going to play before actually starting to play the games.</P>

<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Games such as <I>Go</I> and <I>Chess</I> that provide players with perfect information and no unpredictability to the effects of actions provide ample support for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A>.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A> requires that players have a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> between different actions and that those actions have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A>. Besides making these two requirements exist in a game design, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A> requires reasons for doing the planning and means for players to be able to do the planning. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DirectInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Direct Information</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerfectInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perfect Information</A> supports <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A>, either by allowing players to know the game state with certainty and thereby the possible actions, or by giving players exact feedback on actions. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SymmetricInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Symmetric Information</A> can provide players with information about other players' goals and game elements, thereby stimulating planning, with the added feature that players know what other players know. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PublicInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Public Information</A> can provide players with information about other players' goals or tactics, thereby also increasing the possibility of having <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A> of the players' own actions and tactics. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NearMissIndicators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Near Miss Indicators</A> can help players readjust their planning, either by noticing their own failures or by becoming aware of other players' actions. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CutScenes.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cut Scenes</A> can provide players with overviews of the challenges they will later face.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Activities that require planning include <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PuzzleSolving.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Puzzle Solving</A>, or completing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Stealth.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stealth</A> goals. Especially <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> can provide a great variety of possible actions that can stimulate planning of how to make use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Resources</A>: which <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> should be created by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producers</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Converters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Converters</A>, what <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> to make, and which <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> should be saved in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Container.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Containers</A>. Further, many sorts of actions promote planning: <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExtendedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extended Actions</A> may require planning, and plans on when other actions could be started instead of continuing the actions; actions with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DelayedEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Delayed Effects</A> may require planning to make full use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Timing.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Timing</A>, but <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Timing.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Timing</A> may also be created by planning; having to choose between possible <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A>; and the long-term consequences of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IrreversibleActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Irreversible Actions</A> may require more planning than other actions. Coordinating activities into <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CollaborativeActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Collaborative Actions</A> also requires planning, as does fighting against <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OrthogonalUnitDifferentiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Orthogonal Unit Differentiation</A> or making use of one's own forces with various <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A>. Any <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices or choices that require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tradeoffs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tradeoffs</A> promote <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Planning is made possible through providing information to players and giving them the time to use it. Examples of ways players can be supported with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PublicInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Public Information</A> to do planning include <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Book-KeepingTokens.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Book-Keeping Tokens</A> or other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameStateOverview.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game State Overviews</A>, public <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Score.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Scores</A>, or open <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiscardPiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Discard Piles</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TurnTaking.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Turn Taking</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SafeHavens.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Safe Havens</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ultra-PowerfulEvents.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ultra-Powerful Events</A> can all give players <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Downtime.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Downtime</A>, which can be used for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A>.</P>

Number of players in a game is easy to design, and number of actions can be regulated by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedSetofActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Set of Actions</A>. How many actions ahead players can move is more difficult, as players' usually want to plan as far ahead as possible, but can be modulated by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedForesight.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Foresight</A> or avoiding too <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A> from actions. The complexity can be further modulated by requiring players to do <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AttentionSwapping.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Attention Swapping</A> between different areas of gameplay.</P>

<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A> can be promoted by the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Extra-GameActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extra-Game Actions</A> of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Save-LoadCycles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Save-Load Cycles</A>, which allows players to explore the game first and then try to overcome challenges or to do <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Experimenting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Experimenting</A>.</P>
