<H2>Gain Ownership</H2>
<I>This is simply the goal to gain the ownership of a game element.</I>
<P CLASS="text">The goal of controlling a game element, either by possessing it or by controlling the use of it, is common to many games. The ownership may be a reason in itself (as for example controlling space in <I>Go</I> or controlling <I>Flag</I> points in <I>Battlefield 1942</I>), may be a requirement for completing a higher-<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Levels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Level</A> goal, or may simply make it easier to complete various types of actions or goals.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Weapons, ammunition, and power-ups are all examples of objectives for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> goals in first-person shooters such as <I>Quake</I>, <I>Unreal Tournament</I>, or <I>Return to Castle Wolfenstein.</I></P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>Othello</I> (also called <I>Reversi</I>) has the goal of gaining ownership of a majority of the game pieces, and every turn in the game involves changes in ownership.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The use of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> goal tightly links the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> of the goal with the game element that is owned, or part of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> in cases of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AreaControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Area Control</A>. This usually provides players with an increase in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Score.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Score</A>, more <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A> (and possibly <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A>) from <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A>, or new information in the form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Clues.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Clues</A>. In many cases, the game element is destroyed or taken out of gameplay with the completion of the goal, in principle making use of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Converters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Converter</A> pattern.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">An important design choice for the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> pattern is how ownership of the game element is achieved, if it can change after it has been set, and if it can be shared. Ownership can be the immediate result of a subgoal, typically <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Stealth.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stealth</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Capture.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Capture</A>, or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Contact.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Contact</A>, but others are possible, which makes the goals part of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HierarchyofGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hierarchy of Goals</A>. An interesting exception to this is <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Delivery.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Delivery</A> goals, where the objective is to make someone else in the game succeed with a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> goal. Other common ways of gaining ownership are the results of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Construction.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Construction</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Bidding.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Bidding</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betting</A>, or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Trading.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Trading</A> actions. The design of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> goal requires either that the ownership has not been determined yet or that ownership can change. Using the possibility of changing ownership makes all the goals that have the same game element as goal object into <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExcludingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Excluding Goals</A> and supports <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A>. Not being able to change ownership may lessen <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A> after ownership has been determined but may make it more intense before this is done, as the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> can be seen as higher. Being able to share ownership can also lessen <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A>, can support <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SharedRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Shared Rewards</A> instead of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Rewards</A>, and can force players into <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Alliances.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alliances</A>, which require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Negotiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Negotiation</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CollaborativeActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Collaborative Action</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A> over individual <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> that are part of a class of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A> typically is less intense than <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Non-RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Non-Renewable Resources</A>. A variation of how <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> is handled is by using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndirectControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Indirect Control</A>: in these cases, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> may always be shared, or the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> may be very easy to achieve.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The ownership, if any, of a game element in a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> goal does not have to be public knowledge, for discovering who has ownership of the game element may be used as a required <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Information</A> subgoal that is necessary to locate the element or the owner. The same applies after the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> goal has been completed, either to make changes in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> more difficult or to heighten <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">An important distinction to make when creating ownership goals is to determine if the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> is linked to a removable game element, i. e., if the game element is a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Unit</A> that moves or a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Pick-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Pick-Up</A> that can be moved from its position in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>. Having game elements that can be moved makes the area where they are located a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Location</A>, while using an area makes it a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Location</A>, or strengthens an already existent one, based on the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> associated with the goal.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Choosing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> as goal objects makes it possible to link the completion of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> goal to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Capture.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Capture</A> goals but may create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A>. The use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Pick-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Pick-Ups</A> makes it difficult to share ownership and easy for players to observe if anybody has completed a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> goal regarding the game element. If the possession can be detected and the ownership changed, this also allows for emergent <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Capture.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Capture</A> subgoals. The ownership of the game element may require the owner to do <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> between different game elements under the player's control. Further, as these game elements may be difficult to share, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> for the goal becomes an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Reward</A>. However, if the use of information contained in the game element is not controlled by the game system, the game element can be passed on without loss of the information, or the information can be spread through a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CommunicationChannels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Communication Channel</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Having the ownership linked to non-moveable game elements can provide players with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A> through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Controllers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Controllers</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Chargers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Chargers</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceGenerators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Generators</A>. Further, if the game elements are areas in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>, oftenmarked by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OutstandingFeatures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Outstanding Features</A>, they can function as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GoalPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Goal Points</A> for goals of persistence such as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="KingoftheHill.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">King of the Hill</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Guard.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Guard</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A> can also be the objective for ownership goals and are typically <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OptionalGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Optional Goals</A>.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> is the goal of achieving <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> from other players or the game system to a specific player. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> can be regarding game elements or, in the case of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AreaControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Area Control</A> of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A>, about parts of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>. Being a combination of a goal and the possibility of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> provides two motivations for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A> in games. If the owned game element or area was previously owned by the players and has caused <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AbilityLosses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ability Losses</A>, this is even more likely to increase <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Gaining <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> of game elements creates a sense of progress as players increase the number of owned elements, which can be used as a basis for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Collection.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Collection</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="https://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfa/maltt/VIP/Ressources/Articles/Game%20Design%20Patterns/collection/Alphabetical_Patterns/Configuration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Configuration</A> goals, as well as supporting one of the requirements, gaining new resources, for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A>. If the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> gives <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A>, it supports the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainCompetence.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Competence</A> goal, while if it gives access to information, it instead supports <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Information</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> of pieces can be in a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Capture.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Capture</A>. In this case, the patterncreates <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A>, are thereby <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>, if there exist actions so that one player can take the ownership of game elements from another player without that player's consent. If only one player can own the game element, goals of having that game element become <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExcludingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Excluding Goals</A>.</P>
