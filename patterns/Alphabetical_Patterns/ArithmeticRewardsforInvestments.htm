<H2>Arithmetic Rewards for Investments</H2>
<I>The possible rewards have a linear relationship to the investments, that is, if the investment is double, the comparable reward is doubled.</I>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ArithmeticRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Arithmetic Rewards for Investments</A> are those rewards in game that are directly proportional with the resources used to gain them. As long as requirements of minimum and maximum investments are met, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ArithmeticRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Arithmetic Rewards for Investments</A> allow players to split resources into several smaller investments rather than one large investment with no other penalty than maybe not receiving all rewards at the same time.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>the unit construction in strategy games is often based on <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ArithmeticRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Arithmetic Rewards for Investments</A>. If it costs 100 production points to construct a tank, it costs 200 points to construct two tanks, 300 points to construct three tanks, and so on.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ArithmeticRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Arithmetic Rewards for Investments</A> use linear functions between the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> and are thereby incompatible with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GeometricRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Geometric Rewards for Investments</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiminishingReturns.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Diminishing Returns</A>. They make the planning of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> straightforward as there is no real incentive for hoarding the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> before investing. As the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> can be done in smaller chunks and do not represent so great <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices they give players a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> how to make <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A>. The ease of understanding the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> received from <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ArithmeticRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Arithmetic Rewards for Investments</A> makes them have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A>, both for the players who are making the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> and those observing the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> being made.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text">When implementing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ArithmeticRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Arithmetic Rewards for Investments</A> the costs involved have to be balanced compared to other possible <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> in the game. It is also possible to artificially limit the maximum possible amount used in single <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> or require minimum amounts to be invested to modulate the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices that have to be made. Another way of modulating the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices is to not make several identical <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> using arithmetic reward schemes possible at the same time by imposing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TimeLimits.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Time Limits</A> between such <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A>.</P>
