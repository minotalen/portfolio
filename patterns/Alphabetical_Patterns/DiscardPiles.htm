<H2>Discard Piles</H2>
<I>The Discard Pile is the area or stack where cards or tiles are placed after they have been used.</I>
<P CLASS="text">The use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiscardPiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Discard Piles</A> is common in all games that use cards.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiscardPiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Discard Piles</A> can be either closed or opened. Closed <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiscardPiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Discard Piles</A> hide the important information of the game elements in them and do not let the players go through the piles. These piles can be used to provide an advantage of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Memorizing.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Memorizing</A> (with the most famous example being the cards played in games such as <I>Blackjack</I>). Open <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiscardPiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Discard Piles</A>, by contrast, either place the game elements so that they can all be seen or allow the players to go through the pile. These open piles support <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A> but may also cause <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AnalysisParalysis.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Analysis Paralysis</A> since they allow players a more complete view of the game state.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiscardPiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Discard Piles</A> make possible a certain kind of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Ability</A>: going through the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiscardPiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Discard Pile</A> and taking, or directly using, one of the items in the pile.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The most basic function of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiscardPiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Discard Piles</A> is purely bureaucratic: it defines a place where to place the used game elements. However, the size of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiscardPiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Discard Pile</A> allows players to judge the progress of the game.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiscardPiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Discard Piles</A> are often combined with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stacks</A> to create a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ClosedEconomies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Closed Economy</A> of cards or tiles; when the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stack</A> is depleted, a new is created by shuffling all the game elements in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiscardPiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Discard Pile</A> and making it the new <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stack</A>.</P>
