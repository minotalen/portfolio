<H2>Enemies</H2>
<I>Enemies are avatars and units that hinder the players trying to complete the goals.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Many games have game elements that portray people or monsters that try and hinder players' goals. These <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> can actively resist players' intentions through actions or they can be an explanation for challenges or obstacles in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>With the exception of puzzles, most games include enemies. A typical example of an enemy, albeit initially unknown, is Ganon in <I>The Legend of Zelda</I>, whose defeat is the plot of the game.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example:</B> In <I>Soul Calibur II</I>, the combat opponents are straightforward <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A>, which try to hinder the players' progress in the game.</P>

<P CLASS="text"></P>
<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The primary design choice when defining <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> is how players can <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> them. There may be many ways to do this, which may change during gameplay, and players may have to complete several subgoals before having the chance to challenge the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> at all. Typical ways of overcoming <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> are by <I>Elimination</I> (most often in the form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Aim&amp;Shoot.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Aim &amp; Shoot</A>), by permanently making <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="InterferableGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Interferable Goals</A> impossible or by converting through succeeding with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> goals. Games that provide many <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> can give them different abilities to support <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OrthogonalUnitDifferentiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Orthogonal Unit Differentiation</A>, and thereby <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="VariedGameplay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Varied Gameplay</A>, or vary the environment in which these <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> are encountered.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Another design choice is where in a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Levels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Level</A> the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> are met. They may block paths to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Traverse.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Traverse</A> goal, which makes their appearance likely or guaranteed, they may be the objectives of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Reconnaissance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reconnaissance</A> goals, or may be <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprises</A> in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> goals. In games requiring <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Maneuvering.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Maneuvering</A> they can provide additional hazards that have to be actively avoided.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Having the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> appear separated allows players to decide what <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> to challenge first (which can be useful to counter <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OrthogonalUnitDifferentiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Orthogonal Unit Differentiation</A>), while having the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> appear together can modulate the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofDifficulty.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Difficulty</A> between different areas of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Levels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Level</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The most challenging <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> are other humans. Computer controlled <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Agents.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Agents</A> can be made very challenging by using information or ultra-powerful abilities impossible for players to have, in principle, using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ultra-PowerfulEvents.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ultra-Powerful Events</A>, but this easily conflicts with players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerceivedChancetoSucceed.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perceived Chance to Succeed</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMasters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Masters</A> can more precisely modulate players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerceivedChancetoSucceed.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perceived Chance to Succeed</A> not only on their actual chance to succeed but also what the players believe.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The cause for enmity between the player and the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> can usually be described through a <I>Goal/Preventing Goal</I> pair. By using high-level goal pairs, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> can be used as the main driving force for the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> of the game. Such an overarching goal can then be used to create numerous subgoals within a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HierarchyofGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hierarchy of Goals</A>: a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Collection.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Collection</A> of goals that consist of several duels, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Information</A> goals to gain the identity of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> or their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Achilles'Heels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Achilles' Heel</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> to defeat the henchmen of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemy</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SupportingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Supporting Goals</A> to find the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A> for defeating the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemy</A>, and so on. However, causes compatible with the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ConsistentRealityLogic.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consistent Reality Logic</A> need to be found to explain why these <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> cannot be encountered early in the game.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The difficulty of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> can be modulated by changing their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Skills.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Skills</A>, giving them <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedMovement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Movement</A>, or changing their numbers. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Alarms.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alarms</A> can be used to support <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> and can motivate the introduction of move <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> if the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Alarms.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alarms</A> are tripped. If players can have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Identification.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Identification</A> with the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A>, it can create a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialDilemmas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Dilemma</A> as can having to perform certain actions to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A>. A special type of an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemy</A> is the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BossMonsters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Boss Monster</A>, who is used to signify the final goal that has to be fulfilled to complete a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Levels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Level</A>.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> are the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A> of players that have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PreventingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Preventing Goals</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Agents.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Agents</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> controlled by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DedicatedGameFacilitators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dedicated Game Facilitators</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMasters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Masters</A>. The presence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Worlds</A> causes <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> and gives players motivation for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goals, often through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combat.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combat</A>. As such, they naturally cause <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> as they threaten to make the players lose <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> or<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> (working as a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Consumers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consumers</A>), or otherwise block the players' progress in the game.</P>

<P CLASS="text">The appearance of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> are nearly always <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DisruptionofFocusedAttention.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Disruption of Focused Attention</A> events and can require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AttentionSwapping.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Attention Swapping</A> when several different groups of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> exist. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> are often used to give the motivation for the unfolding of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> in games. When players can identify common <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A>, this is usually a motivation for creating <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Alliances.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alliances</A>.</P>
