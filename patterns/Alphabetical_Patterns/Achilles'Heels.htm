<H2>Achilles' Heels</H2>
<I>A special weakness of an enemy that can be used to defeat that enemy much easier than by other means.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Many of the more difficult enemies in games can more easily, or in some cases only, be defeated by a special form of attack. These kinds of enemies have an <I>Achilles Heel</I>, a special weakness that players can use to their advantage if they can locate it or gain knowledge about it.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>the final monster in <I>Half-Life</I> can only be damaged by first hitting a special area.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>boss monsters in games such as <I>Zelda</I> or <I>Super Mario Sunshine</I> usually can only be defeated by special actions, such as grabbing hold of the enemies' tail and spinning around rapidly or hitting the enemies' so that it shows a vulnerable spot and then hitting that spot.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>many monsters in roleplaying games can only be damaged by certain weapons, for example silver or magic weapons. This kind of vulnerability can be seen as a kind of <I>Achilles Heel</I> even though it is not defined by a specific area but by a specific type of attack.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Achilles'Heels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Achilles' Heels</A> are most commonly used to make <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BossMonsters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Boss Monsters</A> easier to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A>. The two main design choices regarding <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Achilles'Heels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Achilles' Heels</A> are their effects related to normal attacks, what is required to attack the weak point, and how players become aware of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Achilles'Heels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Achilles' Heels</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Three main ways that attacks against <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Achilles'Heels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Achilles' Heels</A> can affect enemies are: through simply modifying the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A>, through having a special effect (for example stunning or confusing), or through being the only way to cause <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> at all. The two latter can be seen as forms of <I>Privileged Actions</I>. When anyone can attack the <I>Achilles Heel</I>, the only thing required is information about the <I>Achilles Heel</I>, while, if only some players can attack it, the weak point can create the need to fulfill <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainCompetence.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Competence</A> goals or acquire the right <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A>. Players can gain awareness of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Achilles'Heels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Achilles' Heels</A> through the development of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A>, through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Clues.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Clues</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Traces.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Traces</A> in the area the enemy inhabits, or through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Experimenting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Experimenting</A> when fighting the enemy. Gaining this information can be a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Information</A> goal and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SupportingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Supporting Goal</A> when part of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A>, which may in turn require other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SupportingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Supporting Goals</A> to actually be able to use the information, if the <I>Achilles Heel</I> requires a specific form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tool</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PublicInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Public Information</A> about <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Achilles'Heels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Achilles' Heels</A> can be used to set the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofDifficulty.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Difficulty</A> to a lower level.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The presence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Achilles'Heels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Achilles' Heels</A> is a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicKnowledge.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Knowledge</A> that players can use in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combat.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combat</A>. This can be used to provide the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofDifficulty.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Difficulty</A> and can motivate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Information</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PuzzleSolving.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Puzzle Solving</A> if the <I>Achilles Heel</I> is not <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PublicInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Public Information</A>. As <I>Achilles Heels</I> often require unique forms of attack or more specific uses of ordinary actions, having to perform them gives <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="VariedGameplay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Varied Gameplay</A>.</P>
