<H2>Spawning</H2>
<I>The action of an Avatar appearing in the game world.</I>
<P CLASS="text">All games where new game elements appear during game play must provide means by which these game elements are introduced. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> is one of the common ways of doing this besides letting game elements appear from factories, buildings, and cities which all act as a kind of producer. When <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> occurs, it simply places the game elements in the game environment and lets it be able to do actions and be affected by actions in the game world.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</I> moves which spawn points are used in certain levels after major events have taken place, such as blowing up a cave or bank door or blowing up a wall in an old city.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>Battlefield 1942</I> allows players to choose where to spawn after being killed from a number of spawn points, where the exact set of points that can be chosen from depends on the teams position in the game.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>spawning in the same position as another player in <I>Quake</I> killed that player's avatar in what is called a telefrag.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>The arcade game <I>Gauntlet</I> let players enter ongoing games by being spawned into locations near the other players.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">Besides the design of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpawnPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawn Points</A>, which includes deciding if they should be <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SafeHavens.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Safe Havens</A> and creates <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A>, choosing how <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> should work is mainly a question of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A>. As <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> is typically the result of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A> where players may have had <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AbilityLosses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ability Loss</A> and may have a bad <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameStateOverview.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game State Overview</A> due to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Downtime.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Downtime</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> players typically are disadvantaged. Several design that can be made to help <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> player; letting them have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> of invulnerability for a certain period of time after <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> to make <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="https://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfa/maltt/VIP/Ressources/Articles/Game%20Design%20Patterns/collection/Alphabetical_Patterns/Camping.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Camping</A> around the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpawnPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawn Point</A> impossible; letting them purchase or otherwise receive <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A> to ensure a certain level of preparedness; or letting them have several <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpawnPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawn Points</A> to choose from so that they have a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> to make <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> decisions.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Besides choosing whether or not to use <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A>, the design of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> can explicitly force <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Downtime.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Downtime</A> which also affects <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A> as well as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Balance</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> can make <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamElimination.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Elimination</A> impossible, but may also be designed to separate it form the individual deaths, for example by letting every players have a number of lives or letting the team as a whole have a limited number of times players can respawn. The setting of the time players have to wait, if any, can be used to create reasonable waiting times in games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EarlyElimination.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Early Elimination</A> but also affect the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> decisions of performing actions in the game which may lead to a lost of the <I>Life</I> of one's <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatar</A>.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> can be seen as the effect of a form of abstract <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producers</A> at specific <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpawnPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawn Points</A>. The action is caused by the beginning of game play when all players perform the action or when one player's <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatar</A> reenters the game after having lost a <I>Life</I>, either as part of normal game play or the effect of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Save-LoadCycles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Save-Load Cycles</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> gives game designs a way of avoiding <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerElimination.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Elimination</A> (and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EarlyElimination.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Early Elimination</A> from the entire game session) while having <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerKilling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Killing</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> also allowing an easy way to introduce late-arriving players. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> create a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GamePauses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Pauses</A> from the players' perspective since they cannot do anything until they have spawned.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> can be used to move the center of the game play so that it advances a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A>. This is mainly done in game with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamPlay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Play</A> after major <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IrreversibleActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Irreversible Actions</A> (and often goals) have been completed and is done by moving which <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpawnPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawn Points</A> are used by which players.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> is rarely explained within the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ConsistentRealityLogic.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consistent Reality Logic</A> of an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AlternativeReality.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alternative Reality</A> but can be sometimes be so through explanations of reinforcements arriving from <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="InaccessibleAreas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Inaccessible Areas</A> or summonings from alternative dimensions.</P>
