<H2>Limited Resources</H2>
<I>The resources available to the players are limited to such extent that they are forced to plan ahead the use of the resources, that is, there is a perceivable possibility of running out of the resources during the game play.</I>
<P CLASS="text">For games that use resources to possess the right level of challenge the availability of resource has to be restricted. This means that players have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Resources</A> in some sense and have to make use of them in the most efficient way to play the game as well as possible.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>in <I>Chess</I> the players have sixteen pieces each and there is a clear threat of losing these resources.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>even though it is possible to build more troops in <I>WarCraft</I> the game is balanced in such way that there is always a need for planning the use of the troops and also a feeling of the possibility of running out of them.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Resources</A> can be used together with both <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Non-RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Non-Renewable Resources</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A>. The main point in both cases is, however, to control the amount of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> available to the player at any certain point of gameplay in such way that the player is always forced to plan and to make <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tradeoffs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tradeoffs</A> when using the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>. This is often used by having some form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Container.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Container</A> that limits the amount of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> available, and the capacity of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Container.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Container</A>, in turn, can be modulated by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DecreasedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Decreased Abilities</A> to modulate how limited the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> are. Ways of combining <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Resources</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A> may be that it is possible to gain new <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> from <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Pick-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Pick-Ups</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceGenerators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Generators</A> but either the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> must be used far from these or that the amount of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A> are limited.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Resources</A> can be used, for example through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TimeLimits.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Time Limits</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BudgetedActionPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Budgeted Action Points</A>, to lessen <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Downtime.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Downtime</A> and potential imbalances between players in games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TurnTaking.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Turn Taking</A>.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Resources</A> decrease players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A>. In principle all games have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Resources</A>, but often some of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> are more limited than the others forcing the player to plan and form strategies about the use of these resources. The amount of available <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> limits the possible actions and strategies of the players, and thereby their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A>. Limiting the amount of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> available to the player reduces the potential actions possible for the player, increases <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A> and, in some cases, gives a method to avoid <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AnalysisParalysis.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Analysis Paralysis</A>. Planning how to use <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Resources</A> is one of the corner stones of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> and skill in making most use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Resources</A>, and especially in making correct <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> judgments and often basis for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMastery.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Mastery</A>.</P>
