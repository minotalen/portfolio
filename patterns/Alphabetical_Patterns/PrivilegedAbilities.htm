<H2>Privileged Abilities</H2>
<I>Privileged Abilities are those that let players perform actions that are not readily available to all other players.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Many games have different sets of actions possible for different players. The actions one player has, or possibly a few players have, are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> in that they allow different tactics and often different forms of goals to be sought.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Computer roleplaying games, such as <I>Neverwinter Nights</I> and <I>Diablo</I>, make use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> by making certain actions only available to specific classes, for example, only allowing wizards to cast spells.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Online multiplayer first-person shooters such <I>as Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</I> or <I>Battlefield 1942</I> use the same method of dividing special abilities, such as repairing vehicles or providing air strikes, to specific classes. <I>Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</I> further provides new actions as players gain experience in various activities.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>The board game <I>History of the World</I> uses cards with special abilities that can be played only on certain turns in order to loosely follow the historical development of civilizations.</P>

<P CLASS="text"></P>
<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The design choices regarding <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> can be divided into three main categories: the actual nature of the action, how the action is made available, and which player has access to the action.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> can take many different forms, but common ones allow players to move differently than other players, avoid the effects of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A>, allow special actions in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combat.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combat</A>, create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>, manipulate the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> system in the game, create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AsymmetricInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Asymmetric Information</A> states by providing additional access to information, or affect the outcome of other actions. Examples are numerous: ordinary attacks and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combos.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combos</A> for use in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combat.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combat</A>; movement enhancement such as speed of movement or ability to jump longer, or in other ways making it easier to ignore or avoid <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Obstacles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Obstacles</A>; <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedMovement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Movement</A> in the form of flying, swimming, or diving; activation of armor or invulnerability that make the effect of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> little or none to avoiding <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A>, perhaps automatic when <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A>; being a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer</A> of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A>, for example to create health packs that remove <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A>, or being able to employ <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Construction.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Construction</A>; for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A>, actions that affect <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource</A> <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Collecting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Collecting</A> for example enabling card pick-up from the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiscardPiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Discard Pile</A> instead of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stack</A>; for information, having <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> with less <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FogofWar.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Fog of War</A> than other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> or being allowed to look at another player's <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CardHands.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Card Hand</A>; for outcomes, control of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A> or possession of replay and cancellation cards that force a new evaluation of the action or that a new action is taken instead of the one that has just taken place. In some cases, even the option of performing a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="No-Ops.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">No-Op</A> action can be a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Ability</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> that are present from the beginning of the game allow players to perform extra-game activities in planning strategies if these actions are known or can be chosen. Those <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> that are gained during gameplay can provide <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A>, including <I>Planned</I> <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character Development</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Development</A>, and gaining the abilities is often done through some form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investment</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> that only can be used or are useful during certain parts of the game put players under a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TimeLimits.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Time Limit</A> and strengthen the importance of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Timing.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Timing</A> the actions.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AreaControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Area Control</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Chargers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Chargers</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Ups</A> can be used to activate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A>. In this case, gaining the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Ability</A> can become a question of knowing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A>, and the activation of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Ability</A> is tied to a specific location in the game. As the effects of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Chargers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Chargers</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Ups</A> usually are under a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TimeLimits.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Time Limit</A> or otherwise bounded, the effects on <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A> can more easily be controlled than for other types of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> may also appear due to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> inflicted on other players; the effect of losing your knights in <I>Chess</I> while your opponent still has them can be seen as if your opponent has the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Ability</A> of making knights move.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The question of who has access to the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Ability</A> can be split into the questions of what <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> provides the action and which players have access to the action. When using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A> representing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> as the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A>, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> can be represented by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Skills.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Skills</A> to allow further modulation of the abilities.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The choice of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> affects how player's can experience <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AbilityLosses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ability Loss</A>. If the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> are provided by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A>, the loss is typically either due to the end of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TimeLimits.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Time Limit</A> in the case of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Ups</A> or a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A> for losing a <I>Life</I> or losing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A>. Besides allowing for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OrthogonalUnitDifferentiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Orthogonal Unit Differentiation</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> allow the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> to shift between players by different forms of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A>, e. g., stealing.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The affect of which player has the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> depends heavily upon whether the game involves <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamPlay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Play</A>. In <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamPlay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Play</A>, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Ability</A> of a player can be matched by the same <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Ability</A> in the other teams to create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A>. This makes the teams have symmetric abilities while providing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AsymmetricAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Asymmetric Abilities</A> within the team and allows individual players to have game-controlled <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CompetenceAreas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competence Areas</A>. In games without teams but with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Cooperation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cooperation</A>, the pattern can also support <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CompetenceAreas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competence Areas</A>, while in games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A>, it is more likely to affect <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Possible affects on <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A> by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> can be mitigated somewhat if they are part of the set of actions selectable by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BudgetedActionPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Budgeted Action Points</A>.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> give players <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Empowerment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Empowerment</A> in games since they have abilities that others do not. This is especially apparent in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Self-FacilitatedGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Self-Facilitated Games</A> that make use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMasters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Masters</A>, since the entire game state is controlled by them and all events in the game must be approved by them.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">By their very nature, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> create a state of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AsymmetricAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Asymmetric Abilities</A> between players and thereby easily affect <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Balance</A>. When unsupervised by the game system, this can create greater and greater differences in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A> as gameplay progresses, but by actively modifying what <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> players have and when, e. g., by deciding the nature of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Up</A> due to the positions of players in a racing game, the pattern can instead be used to support <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">When combined with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> can be used as the goal for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainCompetence.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Competence</A> goals. When tied to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A>, they can be used to explicitly indicate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character Development</A>. In games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamPlay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Play</A>, this naturally can also affect <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Development</A> and can strengthen the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CompetenceAreas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competence Area</A> of players and give them <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialStatuses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Statuses</A>. Further, it can support stimulated<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialInteraction.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Interaction</A>, as players usually need to coordinate their activities to take full advantage of the set of actions they have. If the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> are matched between the teams, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Balance</A> can be achieved even though <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A> may not be.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">If competing players can gain access to the same or balancing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> through completions of similar goals in games using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A>, a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RedQueenDilemmas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Red Queen Dilemma</A> situation can occur. In this case, and other cases where players can gain or have had <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> but currently do not, not having the abilities can be a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A>.</P>
