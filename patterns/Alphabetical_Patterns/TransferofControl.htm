<H2>Transfer of Control</H2>
<I>When the influence over a game element is passed from one player to another.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Many games let game elements, or the control over the actions they allow, shift between players. This <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> makes the ownership of game elements less sure in the game and provides players with goals of trying to change the ownership status of game elements.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Trading in the board game <I>Civilization</I> allows players to collect series of a commodities, which can then be used to purchase advances.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>The special ability of <I>Priests</I> in <I>Age of Empires</I> is to transfer the control of enemy units to the player controlling the <I>Priests</I>.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> are the most common type of game element that may shift between different players' control, followed by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> also addressed which player has <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AreaControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Area Control</A> over various parts of the game board or world. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Collection.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Collection</A> goals require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> events to occur, but the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> does not have to be between players; the control can go from being uncontrolled, or controlled by the game system, to a player or vice versa. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Collecting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Collecting</A> is an activity that gives a player control over game elements that in most cases are not under any other player's control. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> of losing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A>, and the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AbilityLosses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ability Losses</A> these cause, are examples of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> from players to an uncontrolled state.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">If the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Controls</A> are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IrreversibleActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Irreversible Actions</A> and the<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> involved are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Resources</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Non-RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Non-Renewable Resources</A>, the action of transferring control defines a sort of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ClosurePoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Closure Point</A>. If <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Reversability.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reversability</A> of the control transversal is possible, either between players or between players and the game system, this makes the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> used <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A>, as a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ClosedEconomies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Closed Economy</A> exists.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> can be modulated to encourage players to specialize in a few game element types or spread control over many types. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GeometricRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Geometric Rewards for Investments</A> encourage players to focus upon one or a few game elements, while <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiminishingReturns.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Diminishing Returns</A>, and explicit heterogeneous <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Collection.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Collections</A> all favor wider spreads of control.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The actions leading to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> can either be based on <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CollaborativeActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Collaborative Actions</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A> although the former can lead to the latter. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Negotiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Negotiation</A> is an example that enables <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CollaborativeActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Collaborative Actions</A> regarding control transfer through such actions as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Trading.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Trading</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Bidding.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Bidding</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betting</A> is similar but lies closer to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Capture.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Capture</A> goals are pure examples of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A> and are most often conducted through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combat.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combat</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> does not have to be total. By giving other players some control, the control can become shared and require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CollaborativeActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Collaborative Actions</A> such as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Bidding.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Bidding</A>. Another form of making <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> less total is by introducing some form of reversed transfer. Examples of this occur naturally in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Trading.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Trading</A> but may be enforced in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Bidding.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Bidding</A> by distributing the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> used for the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betting</A> to the players who do not win the bet. This form of reciprocal transfer usually has <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> but also allows players to have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicKnowledge.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Knowledge</A> about the difference in values between the transferred game elements or actions.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> provides means of changing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> of game elements during gameplay. This can provide <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="VariedGameplay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Varied Gameplay</A> for players, as it means that <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> that are unavailable other times can be available for players. Depending on how the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> can be done, the presence of the possibility of it gives rise to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Negotiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Negotiation</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A>. Both gaining control and losing control of game elements easily causes <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A>.</P>
