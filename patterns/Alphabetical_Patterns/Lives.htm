<H2>Lives</H2>
<I>Lives can be defined as the number of chances a player has within a game session before it is terminated.</I>
<P CLASS="text">The loss of an individual <I>Life</I> is usually also associated with at least some negative effects in the game.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>Counter-Strike</I> is sometimes regarded as the first multiplayer first-person shooter that made explicit use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A>. The player's <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatar</A> that was killed did not respawn, and the player had to wait until the next level started, in principle, giving each player one <I>Life</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Platform games such as <I>Super Mario</I> and <I>The Legend of Zelda</I> series make use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> but in such way that the only consequence of losing all <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> is that the player will have to restart from the latest saved location.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>In <I>Asteroids</I>, the player initially has three <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A>, and they are lost either when the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatar</A> is shot by the UFO or collides with an asteroid. When all <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> have been lost, it is the end of the game session.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> are typically associated with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A>, but games using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> can also be regarded as using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> through the use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ParallelLives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Parallel Lives</A>. The main considerations when introducing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> in a game are: what can cause the loss of a <I>Life</I>, what are the consequences of losing a <I>Life</I>, and how many <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> are available. The loss of a <I>Life</I> is always a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A>, but the effect can vary. The loss of all <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> typically signifies the end of the game session for that player, but in games that allow players to join the game instance later, the player may simply start a new game session. The loss of a <I>Life</I> usually means that <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A> are lost or that the player's <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Score.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Score</A> is reduced but may also signify the loss of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> or require players to have a certain amount of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Downtime.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Downtime</A> before the gameplay can resume.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The number of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> a player has can be set to a static number to limit the time of the game session. Alternatively, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> can be replenished during gameplay, for example, by reaching a certain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Score.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Score</A> or collecting <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Pick-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Pick-Ups</A>. The possibility to replenish <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> gives the players clear short-term goals and makes <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> into <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A>. The use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> can be modulated by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> to allow <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StatusIndicators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Status Indicators</A> and partial <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> before more significant penalties occur.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Losses of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> are typically the effects of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DeadlyTraps.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Deadly Traps</A>, failing to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> actions by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> or players in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A> with the player, or failing to replenish <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> within a certain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TimeLimits.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Time Limit</A>. Typically, only one <I>Life</I> is at stake at a time (although some games may refer to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> when they are actually using something similar to hit points), but games using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ParallelLives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Parallel Lives</A> are an exception.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Once the player has suffered the consequences of losing one but not all <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A>, gameplay continues as the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatar</A> respawns somewhere in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>. The location where the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatar</A> respawns can be the point of death, which provides continuation but may have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A> problems since the cause of death may still be present. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatar</A> may also spawn in a random location in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> or a pre-determined <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpawnPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawn Point</A>. If the game design uses <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpawnPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawn Points</A>, the specific point may be determined randomly, according to an algorithm to provide <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A>, or the player may be allowed to select from a set of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpawnPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawn Points</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Common goals closely related to the use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LastManStanding.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Last Man Standing</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="KingoftheHill.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">King of the Hill</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> are a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> that allow players to participate in the game as long as players have at least one life left. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> give the players a clear <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goal</A>: to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Survive.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Survive</A> against <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> from <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DeadlyTraps.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Deadly Traps</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combat.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combat</A> against <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> or other players, in the case of games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerKilling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Killing</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerElimination.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Elimination</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">As <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> are typically linked to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A>, they are a way to link the players' successes and failures in the game to those of their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatar</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character</A>. If players have emotional links to the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A>, the risk of losing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> increases the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A>. Regardless of this, the presence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> can increase <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>, as players have something easy to relate to that can be lost in the game.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">As multiple <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A> do not exist in reality, the use of them in games can break a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ConsistentRealityLogic.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consistent Reality Logic</A>, not only by players having several lives but also through the process of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A>.</P>
