<H2>Connection</H2>
<I>Linking or spatially positioning game elements to each other so that they have a physical relation.</I>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Connection.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Connection</A> is the goal to form a relationship between game elements through proximity or by a common link to a fixture in the game world or a third game element. Board games using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Connection.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Connection</A> are <I>Hex</I> by Piet Hein and <I>TwixT</I> by Alex Randolph where in both cases the main goal is to connect the opposing sides of the board with an unbroken line of pieces.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>In <I>Hex</I> the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Connection.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Connection</A> is made by placing pieces on a hexagonal board in such a way that there is an unbroken sequence of hexes next to each other from the target side to the goal side.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>The gameplay in <I>TwixT</I> is slightly different as the played pieces are not directly next to each other but placed in "knights move" apart and connected by a line which may not be in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Contact.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Contact</A> with the opposing player's lines.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The requirement of game elements to be connected can be fulfilled by physically connecting the game elements with another type of element, as in <I>TwixT</I>, or by just specifying the nature of connectedness in the rules so that the presence of "virtual" <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Connection.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Connection</A> can be detected. A good example of the latter is the chaining of the support zones in strategy games so that an area far into an enemy territory can have support by tracing a route to a support point in a player's home territory. The goal of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enclosure.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enclosure</A> can be defined as when the starting point of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Connection.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Connection</A> goal is the same as the end point, assuming that some other part of the game world is also part of the connection.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Connection.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Connection</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Alignment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alignment</A> are closely related to each other. The crucial differences is that whereas <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Connection.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Connection</A> does not require linear <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Alignment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alignment</A> but requires that the elements are next to each other or otherwise connected, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Alignment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alignment</A> can allow more empty space between the aligned game pieces without becoming difficult to recognize.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Connection.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Connection</A> makes use of the gestalt law of good continuation, and as such provides strong visual closures, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures</A>, for players. If the distance between two game elements are in direct proportion to the difficulty of making them achieve <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Connection.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Connection</A>, the game elements are direct <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ProgressIndicators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Progress Indicators</A> of the goal.</P>
