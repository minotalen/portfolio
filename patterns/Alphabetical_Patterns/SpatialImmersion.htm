<H2>Spatial Immersion</H2>
<I>Perceiving movement in the game from the perspective of oneself moving.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Real-time games which involve moving a game element in a game world, are easier to perform actions in, if one as a player regards the movement of the game element as one was the game element. This <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpatialImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spatial Immersion</A> does not require any other identification with the game element and simply makes the cognitive processes easier for the player.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>racing games such as <I>Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</I> or <I>Wipeout</I> put the players in the positions of vehicles moving around racing tracks with the goals of avoid obstacles and being the quickest around the track.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>first-person shooters easily give players <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpatialImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spatial Immersion</A> due to the first-person view the games use and the freedom of movement and view they provide.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpatialImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spatial Immersion</A> is most easily achieved by requiring <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Maneuvering.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Maneuvering</A> of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A> in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Real-TimeGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Real-Time Games</A> using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="First-PersonViews.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">First-Person Views</A>. However, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Third-PersonViews.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Third-Person Views</A> can also works as can other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> with the exception of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GodViews.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">God Views</A>. Although <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpatialImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spatial Immersion</A> is most common in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Real-TimeGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Real-Time Games,</A> even <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Turn-BasedGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Turn-Based Games</A> such as <I>RoboRally</I> can give <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpatialImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spatial Immersion</A> by requiring players to plan their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Movement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Movement</A> in advance.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Cameras.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cameras</A> can increase the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpatialImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spatial Immersion</A> but at the cost of limiting the possibilities for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AttentionSwapping.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Attention Swapping</A> caused by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprises</A> and other <I>Disruption of Focus Attention</I> events within the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> can further strengthen <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpatialImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spatial Immersion</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Aim&amp;Shoot.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Aim &amp; Shoot</A> and other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Dexterity-BasedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dexterity-Based Actions</A> can encourage <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpatialImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spatial Immersion</A> as they force players to consider the spatial properties of other game elements without necessarily requiring thought about the movement of oneself.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpatialImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spatial Immersion</A> is the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Immersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Immersion</A> gained by perceiving <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Maneuvering.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Maneuvering</A> of objects in the game from the perspective of oneself moving. Having <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpatialImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spatial Immersion</A> eases the understanding of where game elements are in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> and the consequences of their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Movement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Movement</A>, as well as how game elements are spatially related to each other. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorldNavigation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World Navigation</A> is a common task when performing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Maneuvering.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Maneuvering,</A> a task eased by achieving <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpatialImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spatial Immersion,</A> and gives players the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Anticipation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Anticipation</A> of being able to arrive at a destination. However, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorldNavigation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World Navigation</A> requires players to form abstract representations of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> from an outside perspective and therefore counters <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpatialImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spatial Immersion</A>. This paradoxical effect of navigating can be lessened by giving players <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedPlanningAbility.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Planning Abilities</A> so that they are forced to base most of their actions on their immediate surroundings.</P>
