<H2>Rewards</H2>
<I>The player receives something perceived as positive, or is relieved of a negative effect, for completing goals in the game.</I>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> are the positive effects that players hope to get by completing goals. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> may be changes to the game state or other game related effects that make other goals easier to complete, or may be effects outside the game.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Managing to pick a box in <I>Mario Kart Double Dash!!</I> or <I>Monkey Race 2</I> in <I>Super Monkey Ball 2</I> give the players the reward of a special power they can active later.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betting</A> in games is a common form of providing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> outside the game due to what happens in the game. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betting</A> can be added to all games to add this form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A>, but some games such as playing on horses consist only of choosing what to bet on.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> are one of the main ways game designers have to encourage players to do certain actions in a game. However, the players must be aware of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> for the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> to be able to influence them, and players must feel that the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> is purposeful either to advance their chances in the game or give enjoyable <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Extra-GameConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extra-Game Consequences</A>. For example, it makes little sense to let players know what a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> is for an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="UnknownGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Unknown Goal</A>, or have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> that only support the completion of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExcludingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Excluding Goals</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="MutualGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Mutual Goals</A> allow for a number of additional design opportunities for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A>, as these goals support <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Rewards</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SharedRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Shared Rewards</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A>. The first option can promote <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A> or lessen predictabilitydepending on whether the choice of who receives the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> is based upon who completes the goal or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A>. The second option supports <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamPlay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Play</A> and can support <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investment</A> if the proportion of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> depends upon some quantifiable measure of effort to reach the goal. Examples of different design approaches for how <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> should affect <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GeometricRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Geometric Rewards for Investments</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ArithmeticRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Arithmetic Rewards for Investments</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiminishingReturns.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Diminishing Returns</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A> can require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Negotiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Negotiation</A> and have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A>, since the player controlling the distribution can make choices depending on the current situation in the game at the time when the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> is distributed. In all cases, the motivation for trying to get <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> candepend upon how much <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Identification.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Identification</A> players have with what is trying to get the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> in the game.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> are an easy way to create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> between players. A typical example of this is the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Bidding.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Bidding</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Trading.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Trading</A> where the possible <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> direct much of the struggle or the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> in games where <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerKilling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Killing</A> is possible and can be seen as a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> for the players doing the action. More abstract, collections of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> can be designed to put players in positions where they have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RedQueenDilemmas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Red Queen Dilemmas</A> and must strive to improve simply to maintain their relative position compared to other players. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> can also be designed so that they give rise to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialDilemmas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Dilemmas</A>, for example when <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betrayal.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betrayal</A> is possible.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> can be divided into rewards that affect gameplay and those that are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Extra-GameConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extra-Game Consequences</A>, typically winning the game or winning a bet based on the game. Common in-game rewards are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A>, the latter of which have greater value if they also are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> such as gaining access to new <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combos.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combos</A>. By tying these effects to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A>, for example through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Skills.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Skills</A>, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> can become permanent and create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character Development</A>, which can drive <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A>. By tying them to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A>, players can instead have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> but may risk losing the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A>. Examples of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Extra-GameConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extra-Game Consequences</A> are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionaryRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusionary Rewards</A> andsocial rewards. These are the usual results of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerDefinedGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Defined Goals</A>, but <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionaryRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusionary Rewards</A> can be designed as formal results of completing goals to provide <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Extra-GameInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extra-Game Information</A>. Both <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Extra-GameConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extra-Game Consequences</A> and in-game <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> can give <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialStatuses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Status</A>, although in the second case it is usually tied to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> may allow players to decide the exact configuration of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> to support <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice.</A> How this affects gameplay depends primarily on when players can affect the configuration: before starting the goal, during the completion of the goal, or after the goal is completed.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The possibility of configuring <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> tied to goals before trying to complete the goals is only meaningful if these goals are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CommittedGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Committed Goals</A>. The commitments may be as simple as not being able to change the configuration later or may be tied to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A>, but the commitments do represent <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices as players cannot change them later. This causes <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A> but requires that players have a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameStateOverview.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game State Overview</A> and that the game supports predictability. Otherwise, the commitment is simply one to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Luck.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Luck</A>, as would be the case with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betting</A> (in contrast to the fixed ante) in <I>Poker</I> before looking at any cards.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Being able to affect <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> while trying to reach them is usually done through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A>, where the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investment</A> represents the commitment and well as part of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A> if it is lost if the goal is failed. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betting</A> is a typical example of such an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investment</A> where the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> is in direct proportion to the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investment</A>. The function between the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> and the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> can be used to modulate player interest in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investment</A>:<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GeometricRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Geometric Rewards for Investments</A> encourage specialization, increases the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investment</A>, and may disrupt <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A>; <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ArithmeticRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Arithmetic Rewards for Investments</A> have the most <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A> but may negatively affect <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerceivedChancetoSucceed.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perceived Chance to Succeed</A>; while <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiminishingReturns.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Diminishing Returns</A> encourage diversification between different goals if possible and may have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> to personalized <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> affecting <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character</A> is common in roleplaying games and supports <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlannedCharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Planned Character Development</A>. In games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A>, choosing what <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource</A> to replenish or what <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Ability</A> to receive can have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A>. Giving <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> to other players is another form of player controlled <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> that can be used in games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Another way of making it possible to affect how <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> are distributed after a goal has been achieved is to embed the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> in a game element. For example, gaining <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AreaControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Area Control</A> may give <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A> but it is impossible or at least difficult to steal the actual area. If instead the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> are given through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Pick-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Pick-Ups</A>, or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A>, these resources may be moved, given away, or be stolen by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A>. However in both cases, change of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> can change which player has the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards.</A></P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The presence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> in games makes goals desirable, and the value of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> raises the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Anticipation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Anticipation</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> for players trying to complete the goals and usually provide short moments of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A> when they are received. Knowing the long-term value, rather than the immediate value, of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> is <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicKnowledge.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Knowledge</A> for a game and is often required for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMastery.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Mastery</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> advance gameplay by offering new goals or making existing goals easier to complete, for example, by giving players <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A>. For this reason, they often introduce new concepts to the game, requiring the expansion of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AlternativeReality.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alternative Reality</A> to maintain the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ConsistentRealityLogic.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consistent Reality Logic</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> that allow players to choose the exact effects on the game state from a couple of opinions promote <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A>. When these choices affect players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A>, this allows for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlannedCharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Planned Character Development</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">What type of goals the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> are linked to affects the value of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A>. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerDefinedGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Defined Goals</A> are, unless the game allows formalization of such goals, social rewardsor <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionaryRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusionary Rewards</A>, without impact on the game state. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="UnknownGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Unknown Goals</A> are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprises</A> but once received, the knowledge of the existence of such goals and their rewards is <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicKnowledge.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Knowledge.</A> Goals and actions linked <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A> create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> situations as effort put into reaching the goal may not be rewarded but may also create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">A <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A> can modulate a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> and vice versato affect the overall value and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> of a goal. This can make a goal less attractive by combining the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> for completing the goal with a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A> affecting another aspect of the game state. Likewise, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A> for failing to fulfill a goal can be partly mitigated by having an effect similar to a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> provide a special relationship between <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A>: the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> occur as soon the requirement for the goal fails, while <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> either do not exist or are only given after the requirement has been kept until a certain amount of time has passed or another event in the game has occurred.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The actions of receiving <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> can be seen as a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Collecting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Collecting</A>, especially when the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> are from goals that are part of <I>Hierarchies of Goals</I>.
