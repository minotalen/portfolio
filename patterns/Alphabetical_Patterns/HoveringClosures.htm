<H2>Hovering Closures</H2>
<I>Events that are about to occur and can clearly be observed by players.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Many events that may but have not yet occurred in games can be foreseen by players and give them experiences of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures</A>. These closures may be used by the players to plan their actions: players may intentionally try to increase the chances of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures</A> that are perceived as positive or simply allowed to occur, while closures with negative consequences may be acted against.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Auctions in games are examples of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures</A> where one outcome is clearly perceived by the players, but this outcome can be changed by additional bids.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Races nearing the finishing lines give strong <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures</A> as the outcome is often predictable but still requires players to continue moving.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example:</B> Leaving an opening for specific blocks in <I>Tetris</I> usually create strong <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures.</A></P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">Designed <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures</A> can either be <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ultra-PowerfulEvents.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ultra-Powerful Events</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="InterruptibleActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Interruptible Actions</A> depending on whether players are supposed to have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionofInfluence.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusion of Influence</A> and a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerceivedChancetoSucceed.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perceived Chance to Succeed</A>. The most common ways to create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures</A> are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DelayedReciprocity.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Delayed Reciprocity</A>, various goals based upon <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Symmetry.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Symmetry</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="https://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfa/maltt/VIP/Ressources/Articles/Game%20Design%20Patterns/collection/Alphabetical_Patterns/Configuration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Configuration</A>, or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExtendedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extended Actions</A> with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TimeLimits.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Time Limits</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ProgressIndicators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Progress Indicators</A> are explicit <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures</A>, which are part of the game design.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures</A> can either be created through the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> or through the game state. When part of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A>, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closure</A> is usually not affected by players but can give <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Anticipation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Anticipation</A>, for example nearing the end of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Levels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Level</A>. Regarding game state, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures</A> can either be due to players observing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A> from <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TheShowMustGoOn.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">The Show Must Go On</A> such as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Alignment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alignment</A> or due to players soon completing actions. These actions can either be those that fulfill <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> or planned actions that cannot have been done earlier due to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TurnTaking.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Turn Taking</A>.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures</A> are caused by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExtendedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extended Actions</A> and events with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DelayedEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Delayed Effects</A> that have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequence</A> s. The consequences do not have to be certain, but at least one outcome must be clearly perceivable, as for example is the case of perceiving the chance to win when <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betting</A> and also in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="QuickGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Quick Games</A> with single actions. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures</A> can create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Anticipation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Anticipation</A> when the closures are related to players' success in the game or parts of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="UncommittedAlliances.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Uncommitted Alliances</A> may be the result of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closure</A> of one player being close to completing a goal or action that can be perceived by other players.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprises</A>, being neither <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExtendedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extended Actions</A> or predictable, cannot be <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures</A> and may destroy existing ones.</P>
