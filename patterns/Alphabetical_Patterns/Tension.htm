<H2>Tension</H2>
<I>The feeling of caring about the outcome of actions or events in a game without having full control over them.</I>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> occurs in games that have uncertain outcomes, when players have emotional investments in which of these outcomes occurs but cannot fully control them. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> can be either due to several sorts of interest in the outcome for players: if they are trying to make one of the outcomes occur; if the outcome has an affect of characters in the game that the players care for; or if the outcome has real-world effects.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Having placed most of one's markers in a bet in <I>Poker</I> is a classical case where players can feel tension.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>The dark and claustrophobic environments in the <I>Doom</I> games easily cause <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> as players guide their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A> through rooms and corridors, expecting monsters to appear.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The presence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DeadlyTraps.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Deadly Traps</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerKilling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Killing</A>,<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerElimination.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Elimination</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goals guarantees the existence of forces that are trying to inflict <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> on players, so these can be used to create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>. This can be further modulated by using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NearMissIndicators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Near Miss Indicators</A>, by making the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> more powerful over time, as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BossMonsters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Boss Monsters</A> are examples of, or by making <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TiedResults.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tied Results</A> impossible through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tiebreakers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tiebreakers</A>. The threat of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EarlyElimination.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Early Elimination</A> is a concrete way to raise <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A> between players also creates <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>, often more than by the presence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A>. This <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> between the players can be modulated with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A>. When the ways to overcomethe <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> orother players depend on <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Paper-Rock-Scissors.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Paper-Rock-Scissors</A> relations, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> can be further increased since players may choose ineffective methods. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Consumers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consumers</A> with no positive effects that automatically consume players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> provide similar <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> to players as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> and opposing players.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> can create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> in games in the same ways as in other narrative mediums, and can be modulated by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Clues.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Clues</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RedHerrings.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Red Herrings</A>, but can also do so in games through modulating players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerceivedChancetoSucceed.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perceived Chance to Succeed</A>, typically by giving players an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="UncertaintyofInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Uncertainty of Information</A>. However, when narratives do not contain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>, or when the unfolding of them causes players to have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Downtime.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Downtime</A>, players are likely to lose any feeling of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMasters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Masters</A> can notice these occurrences and adjust the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> or interaction accordingly.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Putting <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TimeLimits.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Time Limits</A> on how long players have to try and succeed with actions is an effective way to create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>. This can be done as an explicit <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TimeLimits.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Time Limit</A> or be achieved implicitly through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TheShowMustGoOn.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">The Show Must Go On</A>. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> can then be further increased by requiring <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AttentionSwapping.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Attention Swapping</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Another way to modulate the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> is by restricting players' powers or freedom, for example, by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ShrinkingGameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Shrinking Game Worlds</A>,<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedSetofActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Set of Actions</A>, or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="MovementLimitations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Movement Limitations</A>. The<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> caused by dangerous opponents or objects in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> can be modulated by setting the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofDifficulty.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Difficulty</A> and can be made to be present before the threats themselves when <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Traces.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Traces</A> are used.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Forcing players to make commitments and then not letting them affect the outcome, or at least limit how they can affect the outcome, can create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betting</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Stealth.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stealth</A> are similar in that they are activities that require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TurnTaking.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Turn Taking</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Downtime.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Downtime</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="No-Ops.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">No-Ops</A> can create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>, and both are usually combined with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tradeoffs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tradeoffs</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices, and the possibility to feel <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Luck.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Luck</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GeometricRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Geometric Rewards for Investments</A> can create this form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> as the invested <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> are bound, and failed investments cause not only the already invested resources to be lost but lessen the value of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> that have not yet been invested. This form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> can be further modulated through the presence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ProgressIndicators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Progress Indicators</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StatusIndicators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Status Indicators</A> but can be ruined by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerfectInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perfect Information</A> about the evaluation function and all the game state values that affect the function. However, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> can be lost instead of created if the players lose a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerceivedChancetoSucceed.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perceived Chance to Succeed</A> because of necessary <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LeapsofFaith.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Leaps of Faith</A>, extended <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Downtime.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Downtime</A>, or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TurnTaking.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Turn Taking</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Many activities and goals in games combine several of these aspects, for example, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combat.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combat</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Aim&amp;Shoot.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Aim &amp; Shoot</A> activities give players opponents and threaten to take players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Lives.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Lives</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExtendedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extended Actions</A> with<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DelayedEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Delayed Effects</A> can combine the risk of losing ongoing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> with the threats of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A>, for example, through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="KingoftheHill.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">King of the Hill</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> goals and in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="QuickGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Quick Games</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Many aspects of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Cooperation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cooperation</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialInteraction.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Interaction</A> where players have to rely on other players' actions give rise to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>. Any interaction where <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="UncertaintyofInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Uncertainty of Information</A> or possibility for disinformationexists due to player communication can generate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension,</A> but it is especially likely to occur with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DelayedReciprocity.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Delayed Reciprocity</A> or when <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betrayal.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betrayal</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Bluffing.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Bluffing</A> is possible. Examples when <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> can be created in this fashion include <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A> and the presence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SharedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Shared Resources</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> related to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialInteraction.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Interaction</A> exists in many cases for both the ones that can lose from the actions and the ones that can gain, as is typical in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialDilemmas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Dilemmas</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Reversability.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reversability</A> and the possibility to recreate previous game states through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Save-LoadCycles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Save-Load Cycles</A> lessens <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>, as players can replay moments that contained <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> and the feeling is less likely to be as strong on subsequent exposures. Therefore, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> does not usually work together with general <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Experimenting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Experimenting</A>, although they can do so when the experimentation is motivated by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerDefinedGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Defined Goals</A>.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> is one of the more direct ways game can be designed to have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> can be caused by putting players in the position of missing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> or in the position of receiving <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A>, which either affect themselves or something with which they have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Identification.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Identification</A>. Especially <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> and questions of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> can evoke <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>, in the latter case either because players have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> goals or because opponents want to take away <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A> of something from players. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Anticipation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Anticipation</A> is a way to modulate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>, the more <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Anticipation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Anticipation</A> players feel, the more <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> they will also likely feel. Feeling forced to perform actions within a certain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TimeLimits.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Time Limit</A>, for example in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TheShowMustGoOn.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">The Show Must Go On</A>, can in some cases be a reason for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> to occur. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GamePauses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Pauses</A> in general have an effect on levels of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> can spill from games into the real world as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Extra-GameConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extra-Game Consequences</A>, and the risk for this happening increase with the presence, as especially combinations of, extra-game rewards, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialInteraction.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Interaction</A>, and questions of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ownership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ownership</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Repeated exposure to the same form of events or actions decreases the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> they cause, so <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Replayability.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Replayability</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> is difficult to combine, especially if the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> is caused by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> or other effects that rely on players not knowing what will occur.
