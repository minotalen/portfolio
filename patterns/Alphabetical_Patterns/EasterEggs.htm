<H2>Easter Eggs</H2>
<I>Surprises in the game that are not related to the game.</I>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EasterEggs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Easter Eggs</A> are surprises put in games that do not necessarily advance the game story or even fit within the reality of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>. The design of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EasterEggs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Easter Eggs</A> started as programmers' and game designers' ways of protesting against management but soon turned into a gameplay value, encouraging exploration and people to replay the games.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>The first documented <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EasterEggs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Easter Egg</A> was the text "Created by Robinett." in <I>Adventure</I> put there by the programmer Warren Robinett. To find it, players had first to find a single dot object that had the same color as the background of the game and was located in a room that was inaccessible unless you used a special bridge. This dot then had to be carried to a specific wall to let the players enter a secret room which contained the message.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>Super Mario Bros.</I> included entire levels as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EasterEggs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Easter Eggs</A>, including an underwater world that was seemingly endless.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>The whole game<I>Maniac Mansion</I> is included as an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EasterEggs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Easter Egg</A> in its sequel <I>Day of the Tentacle</I>.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">Designing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EasterEggs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Easter Eggs</A> includes choosing where in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> they exist, what they contain, creating possible <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Clues.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Clues</A> to ease finding them, and making sure they are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OptionalGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Optional Goals</A>. Typical contents of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EasterEggs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Easter Eggs</A> include <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameswithinGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Games within Games</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> to modulate the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofDifficulty.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Difficulty</A>. The use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameswithinGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Games within Games</A> and other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EasterEggs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Easter Eggs</A> that effectively change the mode of play may be more suitable in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Single-PlayerGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Single-Player Games</A>, since there is no need to try and synchronize and explain changes of play mode in these types of games.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EasterEggs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Easter Eggs</A> are a way of providing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprises</A> in games, which are extra-game rewards in addition to any other benefits they give. Knowledge about their existence provides <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OptionalGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Optional Goals</A> of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> and may stimulate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialInteraction.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Interaction</A> between game sessions to pass <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Trans-GameInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Trans-Game Information</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EasterEggs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Easter Eggs</A> may even promote <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Replayability.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Replayability</A>, since players can have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerDefinedGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Defined Goals</A> to find all <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EasterEggs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Easter Eggs</A> even after completing a game. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ConsistentRealityLogic.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consistent Reality Logic</A> of an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AlternativeReality.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alternative Reality</A> can be negatively affected by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EasterEggs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Easter Eggs</A> unless they only consist of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> or purely aesthetic effects.</P>
