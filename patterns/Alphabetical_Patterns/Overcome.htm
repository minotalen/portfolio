<H2>Overcome</H2>
<I>This is the goal of the player to defeat an opposing force in a test, or a series of tests, involving attributes or performance of low-level actions.</I>
<P CLASS="text">The opposing force in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> can be other players or other kinds of enemies provided by the game system.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Fighting games, such as <I>Soul Calibur</I> and <I>Tekken</I>, are almost purely about overcoming the opponent by performing a series of successful attacks the opponent is unable to dodge or block.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>Chess</I> uses the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> pattern through a combination of eliminating the other player's pieces and skillful positioning of one's own pieces.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The main design choice of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> is to select the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> a player has to compete against; these <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> can either be computer controlled or player controlled, and by providing several different types through the use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OrthogonalUnitDifferentiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Orthogonal Unit Differentiation</A>, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Replayability.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Replayability</A> of the goal increases. If the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OrthogonalUnitDifferentiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Orthogonal Unit Differentiation</A> is also applied to allow the player to choose different <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>, this creates <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A>. By increasing the difficulty of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goals, a game design can guarantee <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Higher-LevelClosuresasGameplayProgresses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Higher-Level Closures as Gameplay Progresses</A>. For example, games using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Levels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Levels</A> often have a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BossMonsters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Boss Monster</A> as the final <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemy</A> for each <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Levels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Level</A>, which players have to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> in order to complete the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Levels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Level</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The test of attributes used to see if the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> pattern is fulfilled can range from simple comparisons (which party has stronger attributes) to a long sequence of tests involving different actions or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tournaments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tournaments</A>. The simplest case can be exemplified by combat resolution in some strategy games: <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> with more troops automatically defeat the opponent <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> with fewer troops. The combat resolution tables used in conjunction with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A>, normally <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Dice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dice</A>, are another, slightly more complex, method of evaluating the outcome. The same kind of method is used to determine the fights between the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> in current real-time strategy games. The exact nature of the tests involved can represent a number of different fields of expertise, including the use of the following patterns: <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combat.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combat</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Timing.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Timing</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rhythm-BasedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rhythm-Based Actions</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Dexterity-BasedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dexterity-Based Actions</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Memorizing.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Memorizing</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Negotiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Negotiation</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PuzzleSolving.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Puzzle Solving</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Luck.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Luck</A>. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goal can be one of these, a combination of these, or a player-decided choice. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tiebreakers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tiebreakers</A> are often used with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goals to make it impossible for both players to win or lose simultaneously. Many <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goals use a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tournaments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tournament</A> format with the same test performed several times to lessen the influence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Luck.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Luck</A> and allow for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerceivableMargins.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perceivable Margins</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Achilles'Heels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Achilles' Heels</A> can be used to give opponents weakness that can be exploited to more easily beat the opponent.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Computer-based games usually automate the evaluations of who won the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goal, but others games, especially sports and roleplaying games, make use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMasters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Masters</A> or judges.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The effect of fulfilling <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goals is commonly to remove a game element or player, resulting in an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Eliminate.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Eliminate</A> goal and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerElimination.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Elimination</A>. An example of this is <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LastManStanding.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Last Man Standing</A> where the goal is to defeat all other players (or at least to defeat the other remaining player when only two remain). However, other options available to game designers include <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Capture.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Capture</A> (e. g., <I>Paradroid</I>), the fulfillment of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> goal through redistribution of resources, or the gain of points used to determine a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Score.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Score</A>. Other common effects of completing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goals are the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A> or handing over <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AreaControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Area Control</A>.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> promotes <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A>, or at least <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A>, as the player is trying to be better than another player (or oneself). In the process, it also promotes <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>, especially if players have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Immersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Immersion</A> in the game or if the actual determination of the outcome of the goal is preceded by a period of preparation or building up resources and skills. This allows <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goals to be used as subgoals to inject moments of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> into goals that are not necessarily fast-paced, e. g., <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Delivery.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Delivery</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Stealth.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stealth</A>, or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rescue.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rescue</A> goals.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Capture.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Capture</A> goals are very often related in a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HierarchyofGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hierarchy of Goals</A> but what goal is subgoal to the other depends primarily on how their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> are structures and how the players' tactics are constructed.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">As <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> has two or more players trying to beat each other, it is often an example of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SymmetricGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Symmetric Goal</A>. Although individual tests may allow <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TiedResults.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tied Results</A>, the overall goal of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goals are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExcludingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Excluding Goals</A> so that <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TiedResults.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tied Results</A> are avoided. The exception that allows for a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TiedResults.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tied Results</A>, usually associated with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SharedPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Shared Penalties</A>, is when all players fail to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> each other. Both <I>Chess</I> and <I>Go</I> have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goalsthat also are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExcludingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Excluding Goals</A>. However, <I>Chess</I> games can end without any player being able to checkmate the opponent, while <I>Go</I> games cannot be drawn if handicap points with using half stone values are given for the advantage of starting.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">As <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goals usually center on one test, they provide focused areas for players to develop <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMastery.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Mastery</A> in. This provided the usual possibilities for social rewards, with the additional facet that the player may have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> some of the people in the social group.</P>
