<H2>Individual Penalties</H2>
<I>The penalty for a failure to meet a requirement in the game is given only to one of the players.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Most penalties in a game, even those with team play, are focused upon a single player. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Penalties</A> are most often closely related to the actions of the player that receives them. However, secondary effects of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Penalties</A> can have negative effect on whole teams, for example when players are allowed to participate in the game.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>the player performing badly in a first-person shooter usually loses personal health more rapidly than the other players.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>in <I>Soccer</I> the player committing too many mistakes or violating the rules might be taken out of the play for the rest of the game.</P>

<P CLASS="text"></P>
<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The natural way to use <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Penalties</A> is to give the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A> to the player who by his personal actions failed to meet the requirements of the game. For example, the player who fails to evade linked incoming fireball in a roleplaying game will lose hit points. Here the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A> is tightly coupled to the individual performance of the players and is usually associated with individual goals for the players. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerElimination.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Elimination</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Downtime.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Downtime</A> for specific players are always <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Penalties</A> as they are defined in relation to players rather than <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> or game elements such as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The situation, however, is slightly more complex in the case of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="MutualGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Mutual Goals</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamPlay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Play</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Alliances.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alliances</A>. Especially in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamPlay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Play</A> the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Penalties</A> for the players in the team can very easily have an effect on the performance of the whole team. For example, losing one member of the team in a team-based first-person shooter will result in a less efficient team, which can be perceived as a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SharedPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Shared Penalty</A>. A more interesting situation arises when the explicit <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A> for failing to reach a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="MutualGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Mutual Goal</A> or breaking the rules of the game is given only to the one of the participating players. This can especially happen in cases where there is <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A>. For example, after losing a match in Soccer the team, or the manager of the team, might decide to use the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Penalty</A> of banning a player from further matches. Even in these cases the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Penalty</A> is usually associated with the individual performance of the player.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Single-PlayerGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Single-Player Games</A>, in order to be games at all, obviously can only have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Penalties</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Penalties</A> directly affect the game state of a player and is therefore not a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SharedPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Shared Penalty</A>. If the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Penalties</A> are tightly coupled with the individual performance, there are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A> for failing, and the player usually feels more responsible for his own actions which might lead to an increased sense of achievement. Further, it makes <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices focused on the players themselves and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialDilemmas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Dilemmas</A> can thereby be avoided.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Penalties</A> in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamPlay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Play</A> for individual failures can increase the effort from the players to increase their performance levels. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Penalties</A> for mutual failures, such as failing to reach a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="MutualGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Mutual Goal</A>, can create social conflict situations within the participating players. For example, explicitly punishing one of the players in a <I>Soccer</I> team without clear indication of the individual failures of that player is almost inevitably viewed as unfair.</P>
