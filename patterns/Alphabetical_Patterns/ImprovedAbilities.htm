<H2>Improved Abilities</H2>
<I>Players' chance of succeeding with an action as a function within the game is increased, or the calculated effect the action has increased in the game.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Players can progress in games by having their actions effect on the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> increase and by having greater chances of succeeding. When these chances or effects have improved, the players have received <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> and have greater chances of completing goals or otherwise influencing the game state.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> are not the physical or mental abilities of players; they are the effects of the game state upon the evaluation functions of actions.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Tabletop roleplaying games often describe players' skill in an area with a value, and succeeding with the skill requires players to roll below the value with a die. Improvement of these skills is done simply by increasing the associated value.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Chargers and power-ups in racing games often give vehicles a speed boost or raise the maximum speed possible without further affecting players' possible actions.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> most often raise players' chance to succeed with actions or make the effects of their actions more powerful. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> are often easier to explain within a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ConsistentRealityLogic.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consistent Reality Logic</A> than <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A>, as the pattern can use increases of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Skills.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Skills</A> of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Ups</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Chargers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Chargers</A> are common game elements used to provide temporary <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TimeLimits.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Time Limits</A>, while <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A> give improvements as long as they are carried. Another way to give players <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> is to make their actions require fewer <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>, thereby letting players make more efficient use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Resources</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">As a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effect</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiminishingReturns.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Diminishing Returns</A> can be used to avoid letting players with powerful abilities more easily get <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> than other players. In the same way, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A> can be balanced by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AbilityLosses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ability Losses</A> in other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CompetenceAreas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competence Areas</A>; game design can have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> by linking <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DecreasedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Decreased Abilities</A> in some areas to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> in others.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> that give players <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Empowerment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Empowerment</A> and promote <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CompetenceAreas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competence Areas</A>. The improvement is typically a consequence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainCompetence.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Competence</A> goals or the acquisition of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tools.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tools</A> as part of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> goals. Gaining <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> creates <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SupportingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Supporting Goals</A>, as they empower players to influence the game state and thereby can raise players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerceivedChancetoSucceed.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perceived Chance to Succeed</A> as well as create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionofInfluence.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusion of Influences</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Like <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A>, the improvement of abilities is a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character Development</A> and when players' are given a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> to affect what abilities are improved, it gives rise to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlannedCharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Planned Character Development</A>. In games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamPlay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Play</A>, this provides <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Development</A>, with the additional effect of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OrthogonalUnitDifferentiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Orthogonal Unit Differentiation</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> can also, like <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A>, give rise to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RedQueenDilemmas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Red Queen Dilemmas</A> when competing players can have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> several times during gameplay.</P>

<P CLASS="text">The difference between <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> is often one of scale or perspective: are the abilities activated in the same fashion as before, do they affect the same parts of the game state, and are does the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AlternativeReality.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alternative Reality</A> explain them as being different or the same?</P>
