<H2>Producer-Consumer</H2>
<I>Producer-Consumer determines the lifetime of game elements, usually resources, and thus governs the flow of gameplay.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Games usually have several overlapping and interconnected <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumers</A> governing the flow of available game elements, especially resources. As resources are used to determine the possible player actions, these <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumer</A> networks also determine the actual flow of the gameplay. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumers</A> can operate recursively, i. e., one <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumer</A> might determine the lifetime of another <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumer</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumers</A> are often chained together to form more complex networks of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource</A> flows.</P>

<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>In <I>Civilization</I>, the units are produced in cities and consumed in battles against enemy units and cities. This kind of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumer</A> is also used in almost all real-time strategy games.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>In <I>Asteroids</I>, the rocks are produced at the start of each level and are consumed by the player shooting at them. The same principle applies to many other games where the level progression is based on eliminating, i. e., consuming, other game elements: the pills in <I>Pac-Man</I>, free space in <I>Qix</I>, and the aliens in <I>Space Invaders</I>.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">As the name implies, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumer</A> is a compound pattern of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Consumers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consumer</A> and as such, this pattern governs how both are instantiated. The effect of producing and consuming <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> often turns out to be several different pairs of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumers</A>, as the produced game element can be consumed in many different ways. For example, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> in a real-time strategy game such as the <I>Age of Empires</I> series can be eliminated in direct combat with enemy <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>, when bombarded by indirect fire, and finally when their supply points are exhausted. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumer</A> in this case consists of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer</A> of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> with three different <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Consumers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consumers</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumers</A> are often, especially in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> games, chained together with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Converters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Converters</A> and sometimes <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Container.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Containers</A>. These chains can in turn be used to create more complex networks. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Converters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Converter</A> is used as the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Consumers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consumer</A> in the first <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumer</A> and as the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer</A> in the second. In other words, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Converters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Converter</A> takes the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> produced by the first <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer</A> and converts them to the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> produced by the second <I>Producer.</I></P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">This kind of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumer</A> chain sometimes has a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Container.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Container</A> attached to the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Converters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Converter</A> to stockpile produced <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>. For example, in the real-time strategy game <I>StarCraft</I>, something is produced and taken to the converter and then converted to something else and stockpiled somewhere. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> can be seen as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Converters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Converters</A> that are used to convert <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> into other forms of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>, possibly abstract ones.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text">As is the case with the main subpatterns <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Consumers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consumer</A> of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumer</A>, the pattern is quite abstract but the effects on the flow of the game are very concrete. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumers</A> simply govern the whole flow of the game from games with a single <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumer</A> to games with complex and many layered networks of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumers</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The feeling of player control is increased if players are able to manipulate either the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Consumers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consumer</A> part or both. However, in more complex <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumer</A> chains, this can lead to situations where players lose <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionofInfluence.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusion of Influence</A> as the effects of individual actions can become almost impossible to track down and the process no longer has <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A>. Also, adding new <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumers</A> that the players have control over gives them opportunities for more <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="VariedGameplay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Varied Gameplay</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumer</A> networks with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Converters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Converters</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Container.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Containers</A> are used in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> games to accomplish the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofComplexity.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Complexity</A>. The game usually starts with simple <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumers</A> and, as the game progresses, new <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumers</A> are added to the network to increase the complexity.</P>
