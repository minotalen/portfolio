<H2>Exploration</H2>
<I>The goal of learning the layout of the Game World, or locating specific parts or objects in it.</I>
<P CLASS="text">In games where the whole <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> is not know at the beginning of the game, it is often advantageous to try and acquire this knowledge during gameplay. Typically examples of this use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> can be found in real-time strategy games, first-person shooters, and roleplaying games.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Games in the <I>Civilization</I> series start with the players knowing very little about the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>. A prerequisite for being able to plan on a higher level against the other players or how to expand one's civilization depends on completing as much <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> of the world as possible.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The definition of an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> goal is by its nature fuzzy. The player is given the task that there is something important to find in an unknown territory in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>, either specific game elements or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A>, but the exact locations of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GoalPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Goal Points</A> are not known. However, the exact nature of what is to be found does not have to be explicitly known either, giving game designers two different options for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprises</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> often makes use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SupportingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Supporting Goals</A> that provide partial information of how to find the main goal of the search.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">For <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> to be used, games need to provide a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Movement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Movement</A> in the game space that in non-linear, so that a player has to decide in which direction to explore. That said, the area to be explored may be predetermined or be created using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A> or a game board constructed by another player. The latter supports <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Replayability.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Replayability</A> while the former can more easily provide a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprises</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OutstandingFeatures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Outstanding Features</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Obstacles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Obstacles</A>,<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Traces.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Traces</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Clues.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Clues</A> are typically used in designing the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> to support <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> and give points of reference. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DeadlyTraps.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Deadly Traps</A> are also commonly used to provide <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OptionalGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Optional Goals</A> or increase the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> at certain points. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EasterEggs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Easter Eggs</A> are special cases that provide extra-game rewardsfor <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A>. The design of the area in which the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> goal is situated can be postponed by using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tile-Laying.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tile-Laying</A> to create the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> as it is being explored.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Common reasons for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> besides explicitly given goals are the known existences of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SecretResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Secret Resources</A>, for example, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> needed to perform <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Construction.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Construction</A> actions<I>.</I> When these <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> are also <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SharedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Shared Resources</A>, they put players in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Race.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Races</A> against each other. The use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Levels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Levels</A> guarantees a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> goal, since the unvisited <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Levels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Levels</A> are unexplored areas. The knowledge that <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceGenerators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Generators</A> exist is a motivation for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> in real-time strategy games.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> is movement in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> with the aim of finding game elements or charting the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>. It requires <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorldNavigation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World Navigation</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Memorizing.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Memorizing</A> the layout unless some <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameStateOverview.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game State Overview</A> shows the already-explored areas. As <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> relies upon the environment being unknown to players, it gives players <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedForesight.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Foresight</A> and can be used to create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprises</A>. The possibility of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprises</A>, the feeling of discovering new places, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionaryRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusionary Rewards</A> in the form of aesthetically pleasing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="OutstandingFeatures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Outstanding Features</A> can all give players <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> is a special case of combining <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Traverse.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Traverse</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Information</A> and, like the latter, requires either <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImperfectInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Imperfect Information</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="UncertaintyofInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Uncertainty of Information</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> differs from <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Reconnaissance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reconnaissance</A> in that the places, areas, and area boundaries are not known and the player has to get more information about them when there is <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FogofWar.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Fog of War</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Exploration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Exploration</A> can be used to move players into new game spaces, either to provide <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="VariedGameplay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Varied Gameplay</A> by the novelty of the area or provide <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprises</A> to put the player at a disadvantage, e. g., by the lack of knowledge of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Location</A> s.</P>
