<H2>Cognitive Immersion</H2>
<I>Having ones attention focused upon problem-solving aspects of a game.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Many games offer players many possible actions and the possibility to plan several actions ahead. By doing so they let players regard the game as a problem-solving activity and thereby have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> in the game.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Although the processes in the human brain regarding emotions and spatial thinking are parts of what are classified as cognitive processes, the meaning of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> is limited to that of abstract logical reasoning, as the spatial and emotional immersion has specific meaning regarding gameplay.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>Chess</I> and <I>Go</I> are examples of traditional board games that require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> for skillful play.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>laying puzzles can be seen as a game where the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> is completely externalized by the rearrangement of pieces players make while completing the puzzle.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The basic requirement for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> is that players have a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> between actions and need to consider what action to perform. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> can be encouraged by having action and activities requiring abstract reasoning while actions or events disrupting players' attentions make <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> difficult to maintain. However, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> depends heavily on providing the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofComplexity.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Complexity</A>: too little complexity makes the reasoning about actions trivial while too much complexity can lead to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AnalysisParalysis.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Analysis Paralysis</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Downtime.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Downtime</A> for other players. The level of complexity in games can be increased while still providing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> through the use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Book-KeepingTokens.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Book-Keeping Tokens</A> or other forms of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameStateOverview.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game State Overviews</A>. Providing a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ConsistentRealityLogic.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consistent Reality Logic</A> can be used to modulate the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofComplexity.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Complexity</A> by removing the need to have to deal with special cases within a complex environment.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Examples of actions that require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tradeoffs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tradeoffs</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices and thereby promote <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> include <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorldNavigation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World Navigation</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A>, especially the use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BudgetedActionPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Budgeted Action Points</A> or having to choose how to do <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AttentionSwapping.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Attention Swapping</A> between <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Memorizing.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Memorizing</A> is helped by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> but does not rely upon <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tradeoffs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tradeoffs</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices, while <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ConstructivePlay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Constructive Play</A> typically encourage <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> simply because it encourages planning. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Experimenting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Experimenting</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PuzzleSolving.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Puzzle Solving</A> allow <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> as activities in the game rather than as planning activities. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DisruptionofFocusedAttention.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Disruption of Focused Attention</A> events, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprises</A>, and forced <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AttentionSwapping.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Attention Swapping</A> between <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> are all examples of how <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> can be negatively affected.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> affect each other negatively: one is difficult to achieve when one has the other, and the game events that are used to promote one usually makes one lose the other form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Immersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Immersion</A>.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> is the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Immersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Immersion</A> in abstract reasoning about actions, events, and goals in games while playing the game. Being able to reason about these properties of the game does not require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerfectInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perfect Information</A> about them but the game need to have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A>. Having both <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> allows player <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Anticipation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Anticipation</A> to emerge but also gives rise to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AnalysisParalysis.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Analysis Paralysis</A>. Games with clearly <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A> and game states that are sufficiently easy to generalize can even promote <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A> as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Extra-GameActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extra-Game Actions</A> between game sessions. Games allowing this form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> automatically have a level of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Replayability.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Replayability</A> since players may want to test their plans and strategies.</P>
