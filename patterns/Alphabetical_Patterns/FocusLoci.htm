<H2>Focus Loci</H2>
<I>The game elements through which a player's actions are taken.</I>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci,</A> the locations of thefocus, are the game elements through which players can affect the game state. The most obvious <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> are the game elements that can be moved by the player, and the actions they provide are the possibility of moving them.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Each piece in <I>Chess</I> acts as a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> for the players by providing a number of potential actions.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>The stones used in <I>Go</I> are only <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> when they are being placed on the board, since players cannot perform any other actions through them later.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatar</A> that a player controls in a first-person shooter is the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> they have in the game.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Various types of mouse cursors used in real-time strategy games and <I>Sims</I> games are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> that allow players to move between units and characters, which in their turn are also <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A>.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The four main options for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatar</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="God'sFinger.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">God's Fingers</A>. The first three can maintain a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ConsistentRealityLogic.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consistent Reality Logic</A>, but the actions they provide are then restricted by the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AlternativeReality.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alternative Reality</A> of the game. They also allow points within the game for players to have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Identification.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Identification</A> with. The use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> allows players to have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> without the need for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Worlds</A>. The use of several <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> allows single players to simulate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamPlay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Play</A> but requires <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AttentionSwapping.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Attention Swapping</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StatusIndicators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Status Indicators</A> to show where the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> are in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>. As the swapping between <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> is often done by explicit actions performed from a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Third-PersonViews.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Third-Person View</A>, this <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Third-PersonViews.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Third-Person View</A> can actually be seen as a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="God'sFinger.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">God's Fingers</A> are most often used to allow players to have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameStateOverview.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game State Overview</A> and to let them do <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AttentionSwapping.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Attention Swapping</A> between other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> but can be used to provide the god-like actions found in god games.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Although not as common as the three main options, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Cards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cards</A> can, especially in collectable card games, be <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> either when being played or by being in play and giving a player <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Book-KeepingTokens.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Book-Keeping Tokens</A> whose presences indicate that a player has <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A> are another form of more unusual <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Dice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dice</A> are seldom <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> except in pure dice games, since using them is not usually an activity affecting the game directly but rather determining how actions are to be performed.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The choice of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> and the actions they support dictate which game elements players have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndirectControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Indirect Control</A> over.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> are game elements within <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Worlds</A> thatprovide methods for players to affect the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Worlds</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> can affect the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> usually by affecting themselves, other game elements, or the environment in their immediate vicinity, for example, to gain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AreaControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Area Control</A> in the latter case. These <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> support <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion,</A> and in some cases, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SpatialImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spatial Immersion</A>. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> that are not defined as part of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> primarily support <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> but can also support <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Sensory-MotoricImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Sensory-Motoric Immersion</A>.</P>

<P CLASS="text">Providing multiple <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FocusLoci.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Focus Loci</A> affects the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> tradeoffs that have to be made when initiating <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExtendedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extended Actions</A>.</P>
