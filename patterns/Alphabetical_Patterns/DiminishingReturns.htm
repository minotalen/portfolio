<H2>Diminishing Returns</H2>
<I>The returns for similar investments decrease as the player progresses in the game.</I>
<P CLASS="text">To encourage variation in gameplay, many games make player effort have less and less effect after a certain point. This reduction of usefulness in invested actions, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>, or even display of high skill levels are all indications of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiminishingReturns.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Diminishing Returns</A> in the game design.</P>

<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>The potential gains of winning bidding sessions in games have diminishing returns that become more and more apparent the further the bidding session goes on.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiminishingReturns.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Diminishing Returns</A> offer a way to modulate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> in addition to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GeometricRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Geometric Rewards for Investments</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ArithmeticRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Arithmetic Rewards for Investments</A>, and can be used to modulate these <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> schemes to achieve <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A>. Implementing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiminishingReturns.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Diminishing Returns</A> is simple by just making the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> associated with similar <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> smaller as the player progresses in the game. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiminishingReturns.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Diminishing Returns</A> can also be used to limit the effectiveness of different means of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A> in games.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiminishingReturns.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Diminishing Returns</A> naturally modify <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A> where there is a possibility to advance <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Skills.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Skills</A> and receive <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> of the player controlled <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A>, especially in games in which <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Mule.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Mules</A> are possible. The advantages for making <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> diminish as the players' progress in the game. At the same time, this creates a practical limit for the progress while keeping the feeling, or in many cases an illusion, of player progress and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character Development</A>. In this case, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiminishingReturns.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Diminishing Returns</A> are a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effect</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiminishingReturns.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Diminishing Returns</A> can also be used as a incentive for more <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="VariedGameplay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Varied Gameplay</A> as the players gain less and less <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> by performing the same kind of actions and may encourage <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> between players.</P>
