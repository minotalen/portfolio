<H2>Evade</H2>
<I>This is the goal to avoid being captured or hit.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Many elements in a game---for example, monsters, falling rocks, and bullet shots---are directly dangerous to the game elements controlled by players and are best avoided. This encourages players to try and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> these or suffer the consequences.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>Go</I> gives an example of a turn-based game in which <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> occurs. When playing the game, players may have groups that will be captured unless they manage to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> an enclosure constructed by another player.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">Creating an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> goal involves deciding what <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> should to be evaded and what <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> occur it the goal is not achieved, as typically <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> goals have no explicit <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> goals can seldom be completed in themselves, with the exception of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> goals with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TimeLimits.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Time Limits</A>, but can often be completed by achieving another goal: that of completing an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExcludingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Excluding Goal</A> to whatever goal causes the actions the player is trying to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A>. Examples of this are to shoot an enemy that is trying to shoot you or to deactivate a robot that is trying to kill you. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A> for failing to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> something is closely related to the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PreventingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Preventing Goal</A>, but usually means <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A>, the loss of a <I>Life</I>, or control of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Unit</A> (possibly because another player completed <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Unit</A>). The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A> can also be that the players are forced into <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CommittedGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Committed Goals</A>, where both succeeding and failing those goals can have negative consequences, for example, having to fight an innocent opponent to the death for having failed a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Stealth.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stealth</A> goal.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> goals can be <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SupportingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Supporting Goals</A> for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Traverse.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Traverse</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Delivery.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Delivery</A> goals. If the player succeeds with evading the possible<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A>, there may be no need to succeed with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goals.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> goals usually have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> or moving game elements with dangerous connotations such as bullets, arrows, or missile-like spells as the game elements to be avoided. Noticing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Aim&amp;Shoot.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Aim &amp; Shoot</A> actions from these trigger <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> goals but also of course make the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Aim&amp;Shoot.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Aim &amp; Shoot</A> actions more difficult. However, in games where players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A> constantly move, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> goals can also be constructed around <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DeadlyTraps.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Deadly Traps</A>. Any kind of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="MovementLimitations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Movement Limitations</A> that affect players during evading naturally make them more difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> patterns can interact with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> patterns when one player has both. If the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> patterns are not used at all, the player with the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> goal cannot make the chaser fail by directly affecting values related to the chaser. When both <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> are present simultaneously, they allow players to create tactics of offense and defense, e. g., to strike or dodge in a boxing game. Another option is to let a player have the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> goal until a certain other goal, e. g., <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> of a weapon, is completed and then the player has the possibility to strive for the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> pattern. This can be used to create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RoleReversal.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Role Reversal</A> patterns, as in <I>Pac-Man</I>, so the chasers move from having an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goal to having an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> goal.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> goals are based upon not being hit and therefore naturally promote <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Movement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Movement</A> in games. The goals are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> where a player is trying to hinder the completion of another player's <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Capture.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Capture</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Eliminate.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Eliminate</A> goalsor to avoid being hit (which are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Connection.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Connection</A> goals). As such, they are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PreventingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Preventing Goals</A> and create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> as the player is trying to hinder other players' goals.</P>

<P CLASS="text">In <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Real-TimeGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Real-Time Games</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Evade.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Evade</A> typically requires players to be proficient in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Maneuvering.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Maneuvering</A> while <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PuzzleSolving.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Puzzle Solving</A> is often the required skill in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Turn-BasedGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Turn-Based Games</A>.</P>
