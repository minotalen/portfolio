<H2>Narrative Structures</H2>
<I>The structures of the stories that are unfolded by playing the game.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Having stories in games gives players both motivations for the existence of goals and challenges in the game and rewards for completing the goals by weaving the consequences of players' actions into an unfolding story. This <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> does not have to be completely fixed; many games for example allow many different kinds of endings or let players achieve goals in many different ways without affecting the overall structure of the story.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>The Sims</I> does not have an explicit <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> built into the game but allows players to create their own stories by directing the actions of the Sims.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>The <I>Final Fantasy</I> series has a complex story with personal relations as an important ingredient, and playing the game may be as much for experiencing the story as the gameplay challenges it offers.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The main ingredients of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> with their goals, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ultra-PowerfulEvents.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ultra-Powerful Events</A> that ensure dramatic points and challenges. The latter is commonly <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A>, with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BossMonsters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Boss Monsters</A> representing points of extra <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> and possible <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ClosurePoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Closure Points</A>. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofComplexity.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Complexity</A> of a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> may be achieved by adding <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RoleReversal.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Role Reversals</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RedHerrings.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Red Herrings</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> require that at least some actions are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IrreversibleActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Irreversible Actions</A> for the narrative move forward and make <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A> affect the game state, with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CutScenes.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cut Scenes</A> as the strongest form game designers have to control the flow of narrative. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Reversability.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reversability</A>, however, is often used to avoid player frustration associated with forcing the players to play the same parts of the game all over again in case of failing to achieve subgoals in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The unfolding of the story may be strengthened by not allowing players full knowledge of the events to come, i. e., giving them <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedForesight.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Foresight</A>. This can be done by ensuring <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImperfectInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Imperfect Information</A> or not having <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A>. The former can be achieved by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Levels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Levels</A> or by not providing a good <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameStateOverview.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game State Overview</A>. The latter can be done by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A>, requiring players to perform <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LeapsofFaith.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Leaps of Faith</A>, or presenting <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IncompatibleGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Incompatible Goals</A> to players, which they have to choose from. The problems of providing at the same time <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImperfectInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Imperfect Information</A> and using that information without <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DedicatedGameFacilitators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dedicated Game Facilitators</A> make strong <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> more difficult to use in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Self-FacilitatedGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Self-Facilitated Games</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> can either be used to explain changes in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> that give <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="VariedGameplay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Varied Gameplay</A>, or be used to explain players' goals. Explanations of changes often occur at <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ClosurePoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Closure Points</A> and may be needed to describe <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> within a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ConsistentRealityLogic.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consistent Reality Logic</A>, for example the reasons of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AbilityLosses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ability Losses</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A>. When used to explain players' goals, <I>Hierarchies of Goals</I> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DynamicGoalCharacteristics.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dynamic Goal Characteristics</A> can be used to gradually unfold the structure of the narrative. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Clues.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Clues</A> such as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Achilles'Heels.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Achilles' Heels</A> revealed by the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> can make it more likely that players complete the goals, modulating the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofDifficulty.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Difficulty</A> and making it more likely that the story will progress. Common specific goals used to drive <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> include <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rescue.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rescue</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Delivery.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Delivery</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Collection.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Collection</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Traverse.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Traverse</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="UnknownGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Unknown Goals</A> are essential for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> if the story is to contain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprises</A> building on <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betrayal.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betrayals</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EphemeralGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ephemeral Goals</A> can be used to modify <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> while they unfold, but usually require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DedicatedGameFacilitators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dedicated Game Facilitators</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMasters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Masters</A> are especially suited for this and can intertwine <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerDefinedGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Defined Goals</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlannedCharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Planned Character Development</A> into narratives that would be impossible to do otherwise.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> can be enabled by changing player abilities. For example, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RoleReversal.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Role Reversal</A> may represent <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character Development</A> in a story or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedMovement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Movement</A> may allow new areas to be explored and initiate new events in the story. Movement of where <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> occurs is a way to advance the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> by moving where gameplay action occurs.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> are ways to design <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures</A> and<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Higher-LevelClosuresasGameplayProgresses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Higher-Level Closures as Gameplay Progresses</A> and increase the potential for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Anticipation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Anticipation</A>. Although much of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Extra-GameConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extra-Game Consequences</A> in the form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionaryRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusionary Rewards</A>, they can describe <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AlternativeReality.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alternative Realities</A> through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A> and explain game state changes through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndirectInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Indirect Information</A>. This can give players <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Immersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Immersion</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A> in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Worlds</A>, make players feel <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Identification.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Identification</A> with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A>, work as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GoalIndicators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Goal Indicators</A>, as well as explain the presences of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BossMonsters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Boss Monsters</A>. Games that have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> that rely on <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedForesight.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Foresight</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprises</A> for their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A> can have problems with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Replayability.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Replayability</A> due to the possibility of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Trans-GameInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Trans-Game Information</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> usually give players a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedSetofActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Set of Actions</A> of actions that actually advance the story, either explicitly by only providing a few actions that all affect the narrative or implicitly by only advancing the story when the player makes the game state have a specific configuration by performing actions. These limitations on influence may break players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionofInfluence.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusion of Influence</A> or make <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> pointless, as the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerceivedChancetoSucceed.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perceived Chance to Succeed</A> may be the same regardless of what the player does (actually it is more often that the players cannot fail than that they cannot succeed).</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">It is easier to maintain and effectively deliver a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Single-PlayerGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Single-Player Games</A> as the game does not have to try to time events to two different players. However, games that allow players to have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CreativeControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Creative Control</A> over the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A>, often through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Roleplaying.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Roleplaying</A> that is translated into game state change by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMasters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Masters</A>, allow for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerConstructedWorlds.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Constructed Worlds</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NeverEndingStories.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Never Ending Stories</A> in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PersistentGameWorlds.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Persistent Game Worlds</A>.
