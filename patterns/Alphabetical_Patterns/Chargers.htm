<H2>Chargers</H2>
<I>Chargers are locations in the Game World that affect the players' resources when they are in the location.</I>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Speed boosters in <I>Super Monkey Ball II: Monkey Race</I> give, as their names imply, more speed to the player driving on top of the charger.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>Battlefield 1942</I> and <I>Battlefield Vietnam</I> have two categories of chargers: medicine cabinets and ammunition caches that replenish the health and ammunition of the players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Avatars.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Avatars</A> and repair facilities that fix damages to vehicles.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>The board game <I>Robo-Rally</I> contains repair areas, which remove damage from the player's robot if it spends time there.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">Selecting the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A>, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A>, and possibly <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A>, or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource</A> gained defines the use of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Chargers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Charger</A>. The way it produces <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> is similar to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceGenerators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Generators</A> except that players usually do not have any choice if they should be affected by the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Chargers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Charger</A> (besides not entering its affect area), and any <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Ability</A> granted by the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Chargers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Charger</A> may be activated at once, for example, as in the case of speed boosters in most racing games. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> can be handled by simply increasing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Skills.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Skills</A> or increasing the effect of player actions.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Chargers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Chargers</A> provide means for players to get <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> as well as providing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">They function as both <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Locations</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceGenerators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Generators</A> but do not produce any <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> unless a player is within the area, which may require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Maneuvering.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Maneuvering</A> to get to. They are typically used to give the player <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A>, which can be used as goals or to set the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofComplexity.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Complexity</A>. Their presence in a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> creates natural <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainCompetence.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Competence</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Traverse.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Traverse</A> goals.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">If the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Chargers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Charger</A> provides a bonus beyond the normal limits, i. e., letting players move faster than otherwise possible, it can be seen as a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Power-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Power-Up</A> that gives <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A>. For <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Chargers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Chargers</A> that give a certain effect per time unit spent in its effect area, staying on it is a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tradeoffs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tradeoff</A> for players as their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> is limited. If the area that contains the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Chargers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Charger</A> can be controlled so other players cannot access the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Chargers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Charger</A>, this can give rise to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> goals.</P>
