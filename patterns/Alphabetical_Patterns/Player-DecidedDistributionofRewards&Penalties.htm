<H2>Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards & Penalties</H2>
<I>That one or more player controls the process of distributing between several players the rewards for completing, or the penalties for failing, a goal.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Games may allow players to have influence over how the distribution of rewards or penalties is performed. This <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A> may let one or a few players chose between being fair leaders or egoistic despots and can cause intense negotiation between players.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>the board game <I>Junta</I> allows the players who is <I>El Presidente</I> to divide the foreign aid received between players in any manner he or she chooses, regardless of any promises.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>the division of treasure and magic items in roleplaying games is usually a heated discussion between players based on effort and risks taken to get the loot as well as potential use of the found items.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>in <I>Drachengold</I> players find treasures but do only get to keep them if they can agree on how they should be distributed between the players within a limit amount of time.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The two main design choices regarding <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A> are who affects the distribution and what restrictions to the distribution exist. The two common ways for players to be able to affect the distribution is through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PrivilegedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Privileged Abilities</A> or through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Bidding.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Bidding</A>, which in the later case may require certain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> and these <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> may influence the vote in various degrees depending on their values. Typically options when designing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A> are how to divide <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SharedRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Shared Rewards</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SharedPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Shared Penalties</A>, but also to assign <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Penalties</A> within a group.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Putting some restrictions on the distribution is mainly to ensure that <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SymmetricResourceDistribution.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Symmetric Resource Distribution</A> at some level is done, or that all players receive a minimum level from the available <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A>, or to make <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialStatuses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Status</A> have explicit effects on gameplay. However, restrictions lessen players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> and lessen the impact of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betrayal.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betrayal</A>.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A> are a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerDecidedResults.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Decided Results</A> which increases players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> and creates the potential for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>. They make the process of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> into one where <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Negotiation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Negotiation</A> takes place as where <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betrayal.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betrayal</A> of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="UncommittedAlliances.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Uncommitted Alliances</A> can take place. When the distribution or effects of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImperfectInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Imperfect Information</A>, the tension causes by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A> is increased but the possibility of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SecretAlliances.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Secret Alliances</A> emerges.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">As these forms of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> can be <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SharedRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Shared Rewards</A> they are typically given after the completion of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="MutualGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Mutual Goals</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CollaborativeActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Collaborative Actions</A>, and are most common in games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamPlay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Play</A> or the possibility for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DynamicAlliances.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dynamic Alliances</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Participating in actions affecting the events that initiate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A> is a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choice. First, participating in making the events occur may require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> and risks without being compensated if it is successful and give <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> if the events are part of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CommittedGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Committed Goals</A>. Second, actively working against the event occurring can significantly raise the chances of getting any <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> if the event occurs without any chance of getting the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A>. Being neutral lessens the risk of receiving <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> but typically also gives little chance of receiving <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> either. As all <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerDecidedResults.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Decided Results</A> they have few <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A> but also give players <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedPlanningAbility.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Planning Abilities</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Letting players affect the distribution of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> can have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> when players in overall advantageous situations cannot benefit themselves or when mainly <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> are assigned. When several players affect the distribution this allows them to gang up against perceived leaders and the risk of disrupting <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A> is lessened.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">When the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> distributed affect <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>, the act of choosing how the distribution of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> should be made is one of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> and requires <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tradeoffs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tradeoff</A> decisions to be made. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A> typically results in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AsymmetricResourceDistribution.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Asymmetric Resource Distribution</A> but can promote <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SymmetricResourceDistribution.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Symmetric Resource Distribution</A> within the subgroup of players who decided the choice of distribution.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A> may be the effect of dividing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> from a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TiedResults.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tied Results</A>. However, the knowledge that one can have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A> can modulate players' behaviors so that agree on reaching a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TiedResults.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tied Result</A>.</P>
