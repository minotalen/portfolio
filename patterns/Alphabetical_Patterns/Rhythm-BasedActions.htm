<H2>Rhythm-Based Actions</H2>
<I>Actions that require players to time their actions several times in a row.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Real-time games require players to act due to events that occur in the game. When these required actions occur in rhythm, they force players to perform <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rhythm-BasedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rhythm-Based Actions</A>, where the timing and stability over time can be just as important as performing the right action.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>Pappa the Rapper</I> as well as dancing games such as <I>Dance Dance Revolution</I> require players to hit various buttons in certain combinations while following certain rhythms. Gameplay is eased by having music or songs that have the same rhythm the players must follow.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Early sports games such as <I>Decathlon</I> primarily stimulated sports by requiring players to perform long sequences of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rhythm-BasedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rhythm-Based Actions</A> and judging the outcome from how well the players kept the rhythm.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rhythm-BasedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rhythm-Based Actions</A> are basically sequences of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExtendedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extended Actions</A> that require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Timing.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Timing</A> in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Real-TimeGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Real-Time Games</A>. Depending on the nature of the actions, feedback to players takes different forms in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rhythm-BasedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rhythm-Based Actions</A>: where the actions represent dancing and other non-dangerous activities, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ProgressIndicators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Progress Indicators</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionaryRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusionary Rewards</A> usually provide feedback to how well players are executing the actions, but few <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> that affect the actual activity are given; where the actions are related to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> goals or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combat.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combat</A> actions such as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combos.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combos</A>, failing to keep the rhythm often ends <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExtendedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extended Actions</A> but has no further <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A>; and where the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rhythm-BasedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rhythm-Based Actions</A> have to do with movement-related <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combos.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combos</A>, the effect of failing to keep the rhythm often means that players have to suffer the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> associated with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DeadlyTraps.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Deadly Traps</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ultra-PowerfulEvents.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ultra-Powerful Events</A>,<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="MoveableTiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Moveable Tiles</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Reconnaissance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reconnaissance</A> goals can all be used to require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rhythm-BasedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rhythm-Based Actions</A> in games. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofDifficulty.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Difficulty</A> of these actions can easily be modulated by the tempo that has to be followed and by providing the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofComplexity.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Complexity</A> of the actions that have to be performed in that tempo.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rhythm-BasedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rhythm-Based Actions</A> are actions performed with the intentions of achieving temporal <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="https://tecfa.unige.ch/tecfa/maltt/VIP/Ressources/Articles/Game%20Design%20Patterns/collection/Alphabetical_Patterns/Configuration.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Configuration</A> goals in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Real-TimeGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Real-Time Games</A>. The motivation for the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rhythm-BasedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rhythm-Based Actions</A> often comes from <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Worlds</A> where <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TheShowMustGoOn.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">The Show Must Go On</A>, and the players are either supposed to follow the rhythm of an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Agents.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Agent</A> giving mentorshipor to avoid dangers in the world.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">By requiring repetitious actions, either in tempo or in type of action, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rhythm-BasedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rhythm-Based Actions</A> can give <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Sensory-MotoricImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Sensory-Motoric Immersion</A> and is one type of player skill that can be the basis for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMastery.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Mastery</A> in games and give variation to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Polyathlons.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Polyathlons</A>.</P>
