<H2>Handles</H2>
<I>The players are identified in the game instance, and sometimes between game instances, by short names or other at least somewhat unique identifiers.</I>
<P CLASS="text">The players are often free to choose their own <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A>, unless there already are similar <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A> in the game. The requirement of a unique identifier within a game instance is usually quite strict, even if the game system itself does not guarantee the uniqueness of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handle</A>. The same applies to more persistent <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A> between game instances.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>Asteroids</I> and many, if not most, other arcade games have highscore lists where the players can leave their short nick-names if they perform well enough in the game. The players can enter any <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handle</A> in the highscore list, but it is often considered quite impolite to use the same <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handle</A> as someone else.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>online multiplayer first-person shooters let the players enter names for their avatars. These <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A> are used to measure and compare the performance of the individual players and in team-oriented games also to identify the other team-members. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A> are not necessarily persistent from the game system point of view, but often there are sometimes severe penalties for players who try to pose as other players.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A> in many cases are just short free-form pieces of text but can be linked not only to players but to whole <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A>. The classic limit of three characters per <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handle</A> is sometimes still used in current arcade games. Games with predefined roles for the players can let the players select their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A> from a predefined list. In these cases the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handle</A> is also used to identify the players' different roles and abilities in the game. Online games for children, such as <I>ToonTown</I>, let the players compose their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A> from predefined list of words to avoid the possibility of obscene <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A> can carry also extra information about the players, for example, their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialStatuses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Status</A> or if they belong to a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialOrganizations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Organizations</A> such as clans or guilds.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A> are used to identify different players in cases where differentiation would otherwise be impossible or difficult. Besides supporting <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamPlay.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Play</A>, players are often willing to identify themselves in order to compare and show off their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMastery.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Mastery</A> to other players and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spectators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spectators</A> in games with quantifiable measurements of performance, such as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Score.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Score</A>, in order to accrue <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialStatuses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Status</A>. <I>Highscore Lists</I> are a prime example of this use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A>, allowing players to compare the outcomes of their game instances with other players. These kinds of persistent <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A> are used to carry <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Trans-GameInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Trans-Game Information</A> between game instances.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Another reason for persistent <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A> is that the players can form more stable <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialOrganizations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Organizations</A> where the players may have different roles and responsibilities. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PersistentGameWorlds.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Persistent Game Worlds</A> almost have to have some methods of identifying the other players and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A> is the simplest one of these. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handles</A> provide simple means for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Identification.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Identification</A> within the game for the players and heightens the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A>.</P>
