<H2>Balancing Effects</H2>
<I>Rules and effects in games that lessen the differences of value used to measure competition between players.</I>
<P CLASS="text">For games where players play against opponents, the players need to feel that they can affect the outcome of the game. If a game is designed with a certain game time or amount of gameplay, and players feel powerless, these players have to two possibilities: endure gameplay that is uninspiring or suffer that gameplay breakdown due to the players desire to stop playing. To avoid these situations, games can have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> built into them so that all players are more likely to feel that they have a chance to win over their opponents until the intended conclusion of the competition.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Power-ups in <I>Monkey Race 2</I> in <I>Super Monkey Ball 2</I> give speed boosters only to the players that are not leading the races. Further balancing effects can be added by players through the option that makes the leader have a lower maximum speed than the other players.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>multiplayer online first-person shooters often have possibilities to force teams to be balanced in numbers. Some, such as <I>Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</I>, have functionality that can automatically reassign teams based on experience to try and balance the teams further.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> can be designed in a game to be preemptive or correcting. Preemptive <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> try to maintain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A> so that imbalances do not occur, while correcting <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> try to correct imbalances when they have occurred. An alternative to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A>, which can be used together with them, is <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedForesight.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Foresight</A>. This also gives players a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerceivedChancetoSucceed.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perceived Chance to Succeed</A> but in this case, it may only be an <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionofInfluence.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusion of Influence</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Handicaps.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Handicaps</A> are preemptive <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> that are put into effect before gameplay begins. Making <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExtendedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extended Actions</A> into <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="InterruptibleActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Interruptible Actions</A> is a form of preemptive <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effect</A> as other players can interfere with the actions, especially if they do not have any effect before they are completed. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DelayedEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Delayed Effects</A> in general have a certain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effect</A>, as they give players the possibility to prepare for the effects. Other ways of creating preemptive <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> consist of designing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionaryRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusionary Rewards</A>, requiring <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tradeoffs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tradeoffs</A>, allowing players to choose <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SelectableSetsofGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Selectable Sets of Goals</A> that best fit their abilities, or providing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiminishingReturns.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Diminishing Return</A> to players that otherwise could become clear leaders. If the effects are direct, these effects can ruin the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionofInfluence.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusion of Influence</A> for players and even make them avoid trying to achieve what should be goals for them. Having <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> affect the players indirectly can solve this, for example through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Character Development</A> or making <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A> additions to those already used with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BudgetedActionPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Budgeted Action Points</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Examples of correcting <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> include giving <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Abilities</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A> to disadvantaged players and giving <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AbilityLosses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ability Losses</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DecreasedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Decreased Abilities</A> to advantaged players. The classic case used in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Race.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Races</A> is a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DecreasedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Decreased Ability</A> in the form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="MovementLimitations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Movement Limitation</A> giving a lower maximum speed. To avoid players losing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IllusionofInfluence.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Illusion of Influences</A>, the positive effects are usually <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> to the disadvantaged players for completing goals, while the negative effects are usually <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> to the advantaged players for failing goals. The evaluation function that determines the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> is for the same reason often hidden from players, for example, by making all <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Pick-Ups.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Pick-Ups</A> look the same though they have different effects, or by hiding the actual rolling of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Dice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dice</A> to be able to fudge the results. Another example of a correcting is to decide the order of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TurnTaking.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Turn Taking</A> so that disadvantaged players give the most advantageous positions.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TransferofControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Transfer of Control</A> can also be used to correct imbalances, but these are often linked to the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> of any of the players. A common solution is to have forced <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SharedRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Shared Rewards</A>, so that the player who gains the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> must share it with someone else, typically the most disadvantaged player. Controlling how <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A> occurs can also be corrective, either placing disadvantaged players at <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Locations</A> or placing advantaged players at bad locations.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Games with more than two teams or players competing against each other automatically have some corrective <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A>. Players in these games perceived as leading may be the starting point of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="MutualGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Mutual Goals</A> for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="UncommittedAlliances.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Uncommitted Alliances</A>, which have the intentions of ganging up against the leader. This is common in games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="KingoftheHill.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">King of the Hill</A> goals but can also be found in games that allow <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerDecidedResults.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Decided Results</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A>. Sufficient <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameStateOverview.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game State Overviews</A>, for example, public <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Score.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Scores</A>, so players can notice leaders, are required for this form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effect</A> to occur.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMasters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Masters</A>, as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DedicatedGameFacilitators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dedicated Game Facilitators</A> that have constant access to the complete game state and can enforce their own <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerDecidedResults.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Decided Results</A>, can perform both preemptive and corrective balancing effects during gameplay.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Games using primarily <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A> to judge outcomes can easily be designed to have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> over time or when considering several game sessions together. However, games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DedicatedGameFacilitators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dedicated Game Facilitators</A> can fake the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A>, for example, the results of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Dice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dice</A> rolls, to explicitly create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> during gameplay.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The presence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> strengthens or prolongs players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerceivedChancetoSucceed.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perceived Chance to Succeed</A> but lessens the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerceivableMargins.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perceivable Margins</A> of the game and removes feelings of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMastery.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Mastery</A> in the game. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="BalancingEffects.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Balancing Effects</A> often provide the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RightLevelofDifficulty.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Right Level of Difficulty</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SmoothLearningCurves.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Smooth Learning Curves</A> in games by making challenges sufficiently difficult.</P>
