<H2>Continuous Goals</H2>
<I>Goals that require the player to maintain a subset of a certain game state within certain limits.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Continuous Goals are goals which are achieved by making sure a given condition is maintained for a certain period of time. Rather than just having to fulfill a condition at a specific point in gameplay, the player must ensure that the condition is not broken through passiveness, game events, or other players' actions. Many, if not most, of the games having <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> also have as subgoal to first reach the required game state condition of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goal</A>.</P>

<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Multiplayer first-person shooters such as <I>Battlefield 1942</I> have modes where teams score points (or reduce ticks from the opposing team) by controlling strategic locations.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>the goal for the king in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="KingoftheHill.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">King of the Hill</A> is to maintain the game state of being the king while the other players have the goal of changing that game state. The same situation appears in <I>Tag</I>, but reversed; the chasing player, "it", has a goal to change the game state by role reversalwhile the other players try to maintain the state.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> can easily be constructed by modifying the scoring mechanics of a goal so that they do not depend on the fulfillment of a game state but rather on maintaining a game state. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PreventingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Preventing Goals</A> are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> since basically they are defined as maintaining the game state which is the inversion of the game state of the goal to be prevented. Examples of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Reconnaissance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reconnaissance</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Guard.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Guard</A>, and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="KingoftheHill.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">King of the Hill</A>, of which the two latter make use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GoalPoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Goal Points</A>. Other examples are maintaining <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndirectControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Indirect Control</A> of game elements or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AreaControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Area Control</A> of parts of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlannedCharacterDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Planned Character Development</A> is a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goal</A> since it usually requires many actions and subgoals to be perform while continually striving for the goal. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> can also be defined negatively, e. g. as not performing an otherwise possible and maybe beneficial action.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Unless there is a risk of the game state to be lost, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> can become uninteresting. This can be avoided by making the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goal</A> also be a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PreventingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Preventing Goal</A>. A typical way to create this risk is to use <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Survive.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Survive</A> as a <I>Continuous Goal,</I> which is a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PreventingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Preventing Goal</A> to other players' <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Eliminate.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Eliminate</A> goal.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> can be completed if they are combined with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PreventingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Preventing Goals</A> or if they are limited by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TimeLimits.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Time Limits</A> but not all <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> have end conditions. These latter kinds of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> are usually <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Race.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Races</A> between players were the level of success of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goal</A> determines the winner of the race. This can be achieved by measuring and comparing how long a player has been able to maintain the required game state compared to other players.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> modulate the use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> by threatening with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> as soon as the player fails some action while waiting with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> until some additional requirement is met. For example, players may be threatened by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AbilityLosses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ability Losses</A> if failing the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goal</A> of keeping <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> alive but do not have any explicit end conditions which led to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> specifically for keeping the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> alive.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> create natural <I>Hierarchies of Goals</I> with the goal of achieving the game state that is to be maintained in the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goal</A>. These goals are a way to expand the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> of a non-continuous goal; although the closure of achieving the game state of the latter still exists, this is primarily a prerequisite for the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goal</A> and the player must continue to struggle to benefit from the achievement. This can either require player to make explicit <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExtendedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extended Actions</A> or perform a number of different actions, which can be seen as implicit compound <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExtendedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extended Actions</A>, that maintain the game state within certain boundaries.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goals</A> are by nature <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closures</A>. If the player can affect the game state so that the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ContinuousGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Continuous Goal</A> no longer is maintained, this can be seen as a deliberate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="HoveringClosures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Hovering Closure</A>.</P>
