<H2>Drawing Stacks</H2>
<I>A Drawing Stack is the collection of cards or tiles that are drawn in sequence by the players.</I>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stacks</A> are used in card games that do not distribute all cards or tiles to the players at the beginning of the game.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>A special case can be found in collectable card games, such as <I>Magic: The Gathering,</I> where players get to construct their own <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stacks</A> before the gameplay begins.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">Although <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stacks</A> are most commonly used for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Cards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cards</A> they can also be used for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tiles</A>, and then most often to introduce <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A> into <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tile-Laying.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tile-Laying</A>. Multiple <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stacks</A> can be used to allow the players to perceive a chance of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Luck.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Luck</A> as well as making it easier to judge the individual sizes of the stacks. If certain categories of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Cards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cards</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tiles</A> are specially marked, multiple stacks may also be used to distinguish these and let players choose within which subset of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Cards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cards</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tiles</A> they draw. A special case of having additional <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stacks</A> is to use drafting, i. e. by having some <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Cards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cards</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tiles</A> placed openly beside the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stack</A>, which can be chosen instead of the topmost items from the stack.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stacks</A> are usually combined with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DiscardPiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Discard Piles</A>, stacks of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Cards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cards</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tiles.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tiles</A> that have been used in the game after having been drawn.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Collectable card games allow the players to have individual <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stacks</A> which they have created within certain boundaries. This allows the players to create various strategies and make <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tradeoffs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tradeoffs</A> between commonality and the variety of the types of cards.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stacks</A> are a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Container.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Container</A> for game elements. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stacks</A> makes it possible to define the exact distribution of outcomes while providing a random and secret sequence in which they occur. However, the order is set once the stack has been shuffled. Many card games use <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stacks</A> to postpone the distribution of cards to the players, in effect causing the players to have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImperfectInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Imperfect Information</A> and only <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedForesight.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Foresight</A> of the resources they will have, forcing them to plan for several possible distribution possibilities. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DrawingStacks.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Drawing Stacks</A> give players a sense of how many cards have been played and how many are left to play, which can support <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A>.</P>
