<H2>Resource Management</H2>
<I>The players have to plan, manage, and control resource flows within the game in order to reach the goals of the game.</I>
<P CLASS="text">All games where the use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> is not simply used for bookkeeping require players to perform <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A>. This includes deciding how to use <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> to perform different actions and strive towards different goals as well as planning on how to acquire new <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> and judging which <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> will be most valuable in the future.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Almost all strategy games, including real-time ones, have a strong <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> component. The final goal is usually just to overcome the opponents by maximizing the use of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> available.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>Magic: The Gathering</I>, as well as other collectable card games, has <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> in at least three layers. First, when playing a single game instance the cards in the deck selected for the game are the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> that have to be managed to overcome the opponents; second, the cards for that deck usually have to be selected from a much larger collection of cards available; and third, managing the whole collection consists of buying new cards, trading cards with other people, and other methods of obtaining the cards. The last layer of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> often involves the use of extra-game <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>, usually real money.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Professional team sports such as <I>Soccer</I> and <I>Ice Hockey</I> have a high level <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> layer for managing the composition of the teams.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The basic building block for instantiating <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> in the game is to have some sort of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Resources</A>, which have a direct impact on the possibilities of reaching the goals of the game through the use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producers</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Consumers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consumers</A>. In <I>Chess</I>, for example, the players have 16 pieces each at the start, and these are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Non-RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Non-Renewable Resources</A>. The use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A> as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Resources</A> often creates more complex games, especially when there are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumer</A> chains with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Converters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Converters</A> for creating the final <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> from the basic <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A>. For example, in <I>Age of Empires</I>, the basic <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>, such as wood and food, first have to be gathered from <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceLocations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Locations</A> back to the stockpiles, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Container.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Containers</A>, and then these <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> can be refined in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Converters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Converters</A> to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A>. In some games, the renewal rate of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RenewableResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Renewable Resources</A> can also be one of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> to be managed.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Interesting variations of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A> where the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> to be managed are, as the name implies, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> of the game and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AttentionSwapping.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Attention Swapping</A>, where the players' attention is the basic <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource</A> to be managed. In many cases of team-oriented <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="MultiplayerGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Multiplayer Games</A>, the players themselves are also <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>, which have to be managed as part of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TeamDevelopment.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Team Development</A>. This management level can lead to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialOrganizations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Organizations</A> where there is a hierarchy of control similar to the hierarchy of military operations.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">In any case, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> can become uninteresting if there are no <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tradeoffs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tradeoffs</A> with associated <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> structures. This can happen especially in cases where the availability of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> is out of balance or where there is a dominant strategy for maximizing the utility of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Book-KeepingTokens.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Book-Keeping Tokens</A> are not used for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> since they do not require any active decisions, investments, or risks on any players' behalf.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> gives players a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A> of how to use <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producers</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Consumers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consumers</A> in a game and often causes <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GainOwnership.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Gain Ownership</A> goals. Games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> usually involve long-term <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A>, and this kind of strategic thinking can lead to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A>. Games involving management of complex <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Producer-Consumer.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Producer-Consumer</A> chains can make <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> a means through which players can develop <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMastery.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Mastery</A>. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> involved in these games ranges from controlling the immediate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>, for example <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Units</A> in a strategy game, to making long term <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A>, such as research in <I>Civilization</I> to increase the number of different <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Units.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Unit</A> types available.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">If it is possible to quantify how well the players have performed <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A>, this can be used as a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tiebreakers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tiebreaker</A>.</P>
