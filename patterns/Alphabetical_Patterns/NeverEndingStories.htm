<H2>Never Ending Stories</H2>
<I>Stories in games which have no predefined ends.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Some games with stories in them have no points where the game ends. This means that the story continues until players or game facilitators lose interesting in playing the game.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>The Sims</I> can be played for as long as the players want to influence the characters actions.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>MUDs and MMORPGs have world stories that continuously develop as long as the server providing the game is running and players or game facilitators affect the game state.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NeverEndingStories.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Never Ending Stories</A> require the presence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DedicatedGameFacilitators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dedicated Game Facilitators</A>, players with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CreativeControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Creative Control</A> over the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A>, or evaluation functions that can generate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> based on the current game state and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A>. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NeverEndingStories.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Never Ending Stories</A> do not have to be contained within one game session; roleplaying games, for example, can have long pauses between playing different scenarios that continue a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NeverEndingStories.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Never Ending Story</A> and feel more like different game sessions with the storiespassed between them as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Trans-GameInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Trans-Game Information</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The use of players to provide narrative input allows <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerConstructedWorlds.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Constructed Worlds</A>, which often are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PersistentGameWorlds.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Persistent Game Worlds</A> so that players can develop <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A> for the development of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NeverEndingStories.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Never Ending Stories</A> allow <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A> that as long as they do not repeat themselves continuously have the potential for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Surprises.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Surprises</A>. Since it may be difficult to know what parts of the game state can be required for future parts of the narrative, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NeverEndingStories.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Never Ending Stories</A> rarely have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ClosurePoints.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Closure Points</A>.</P>
