<H2>Storytelling</H2>
<I>The act of telling storieswithin the game.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Some games promote players to tell stories within games. This may be retelling of actions and events that players have done, the history of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>, or part of creating the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B><I>Once upon a Time</I> is a card game based around storytelling. Players play cards with story concepts to be allowed to continue the story based upon the narrative started by other players.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>The role of game masters in roleplaying games is partly that of storyteller, merging the preplanned events with the actions the players have performed within the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A>. The gameplay in these games is based on <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A> assisted with background material such as maps and rulebooks.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A> in games can be done both by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DedicatedGameFacilitators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dedicated Game Facilitators</A> and by players. The stories told do not have to be part of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> but can be in several different ways. First, they can be explanations of the history and current state of the <I>Alternative</I> <I>Reality</I> of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> and this is the typical way <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A> is done by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DedicatedGameFacilitators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dedicated Game Facilitators</A> to advance the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A>. Second, the stories can be part of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Roleplaying.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Roleplaying</A>, the retelling of previous gameplay within <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ConsistentRealityLogic.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consistent Reality Logic</A>. Third, the stories can be part of creating and expanding the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structure</A> rather than unfolding an existing structure, although this requires <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMasters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Masters</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Self-FacilitatedGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Self-Facilitated Games</A>. Providing back stories for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A> is an area where players usually are allowed <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CreativeControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Creative Control</A> for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A>, even in games with tightly restricted <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NarrativeStructures.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Narrative Structures</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A> gives both players and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DedicatedGameFacilitators.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Dedicated Game Facilitators</A> the possibility to explain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Extra-GameInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extra-Game Information</A> in a context so that it does not disturb a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ConsistentRealityLogic.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consistent Reality Logic</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A> by players or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMasters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Masters</A> may be controlled through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="TurnTaking.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Turn Taking</A> or be <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="InterruptibleActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Interruptible Actions</A>. In contrast, the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A> done in computer games, for example by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CutScenes.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cut Scenes</A>, is a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ultra-PowerfulEvents.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ultra-Powerful Event</A> that cannot be interrupted although they may be skipped.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A> can be used to frame all actions and events in a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> within the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ConsistentRealityLogic.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Consistent Reality Logic</A> of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AlternativeReality.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alternative Reality</A> and can visualize the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> and its history. When the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A> is performed by enacting <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Characters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Characters</A>, the activity gives rise to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Roleplaying.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Roleplaying</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">When <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A> is performed by humans, it is a form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialInteraction.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Interaction</A> that often gives <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A>, and being able to tell stories well can give <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialStatuses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Status</A> and can even be considered part of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMastery.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Mastery</A> in some games. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A> can give players <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CreativeControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Creative Control</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A>, and in games with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMasters.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Masters</A>, these stories can become part <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerConstructedWorlds.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Constructed Worlds</A> by being <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerDecidedResults.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Decided Results</A>. In <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PersistentGameWorlds.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Persistent Game Worlds</A>, the stories can have further influence by being part of the development of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NeverEndingStories.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Never Ending Stories</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Games can of course also cause <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A> as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Extra-GameActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extra-Game Actions</A>, for example, bragging about results. In this case, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Storytelling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Storytelling</A> passes <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Trans-GameInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Trans-Game Information</A> between players including possible <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StrategicKnowledge.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Strategic Knowledge</A>.</P>
