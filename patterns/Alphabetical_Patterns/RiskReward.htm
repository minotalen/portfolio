<H2>Risk/Reward</H2>
<I>That the chance for receiving a Reward in the game is linked to some risk of receiving a Penalty if the player fails to acquire the Reward.</I>
<P CLASS="text">Interesting choices in games must have the potential for both advantageous and disadvantageous effects. Although players do not normally strive to have the disadvantageous effects, these may be unavoidable, and performing the actions at all can depend heavily on the chance of gaining the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> and the risk of gaining the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalty</A>. This kind of decision-making is based on <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Choosing to fold, follow, or raise in <I>Poker</I> is a classic example of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A>: what is the chance of winning compared to the size of the pot?</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Lotteries present simple <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices where often a small investment gives a small chance of winning a large <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> but the only risk lies in losing the initial investment. That the sum of small investments are more that the large <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> seldom discourages players to feel tension or luck influence, and this may be the only way for the players to have any chance of getting the large <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A>.</P>

<P CLASS="text"></P>
<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> requires that the game does not have completely <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PredictableConsequences.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Predictable Consequences</A> regarding a certain part of gameplay. Thus, the prime variables a game designer has when designing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> are the probabilities of getting the reward and receiving the penalty. These, together with the actual <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A>, produce the final basis for players to make choices. The basis can only in rare or simple cases be evaluated regardless of player situation and game context. Note that players may not be in direct control of the actions leading to the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A>: letting another player perform actions is a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choice in itself. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="MetaGames.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Meta Games</A> can modulate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices beyond the current game state, as for example is the effect of introducing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betting</A> on the outcome of a game.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The three main ways of introducing risk of failing to gain the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reward</A> is through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A>, performing the wrong action, and the possibility of other players to affect the outcomes. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A> can provide the simplest forms of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices since players may know distributions and exact chances to succeed with actions, for example, through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Skills.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Skills</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Randomness.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Randomness</A> in these choices allows for players to feel <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Luck.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Luck</A>, where doing <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LeapsofFaith.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Leaps of Faith</A> is one such example. The possibility of performing the wrong actions depends on players having <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImperfectInformation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Imperfect Information</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="FreedomofChoice.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Freedom of Choice</A>, and commonly exists in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Experimenting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Experimenting</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Combat.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Combat</A> activities, as well as goals requiring <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Stealth.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stealth</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SupportingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Supporting Goals</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IncompatibleGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Incompatible Goals</A> allow players to make choices that give them <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A>, but these may not be as coveted as other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> when they finally are received. Common ways to allow other players to affect the outcome are through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerKilling.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Killing</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="InterruptibleActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Interruptible Actions</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Player-DecidedDistributionofRewards&amp;Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player-Decided Distribution of Rewards &amp; Penalties</A>, or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialDilemmas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Dilemmas</A> such as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betrayal.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betrayal</A>. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="UncommittedAlliances.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Uncommitted Alliances</A>, especially with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualPenalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Penalties</A>, increase the risk of participating in such activities, as <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Penalties.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Penalties</A> do not necessarily exist for negatively affecting other players by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betrayal.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betrayal</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The possibility for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices in games is infinite, but examples include: risking <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Damage.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Damage</A> to gain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> or perform actions; choosing which <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="NewAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">New Ability</A> to get; using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> to perform actions even if this will lead to future <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="DecreasedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Decreased Abilities</A>, especially when <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LimitedResources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Limited Resources</A> are involved; how to do <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ResourceManagement.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resource Management</A> in general, for example, what <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> to make, what area of several to <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Guard.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Guard</A>, whether to stay on <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Chargers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Chargers</A>, whether to enter areas with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="MovementLimitations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Movement Limitation</A>, selecting the location for <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Spawning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Spawning</A>, choosing what part of the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameWorld.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game World</A> to try and achieve <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AreaControl.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Area Control</A> over, trying to orchestrate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RoleReversal.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Role Reversals</A>, and deciding for how long to use a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Mule.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Mule</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Rewards</A> can be modulated in several ways to make the choices have long-term effects. Having a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SelectableSetsofGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Selectable Sets of Goals</A> forces players to choose the order in which to complete the goals; <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Bluffing.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Bluffing</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Betting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Betting</A>, and other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExtendedActions.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Extended Actions</A> that are part of<A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CommittedGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Committed Goals</A> make players initiate actions and not reveal the result until later; <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CommittedGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Committed Goals</A> not only may force players to make <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices but make them estimate the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> of the choices after a while of gameplay. The <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Rewards</A> of having to place <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> is lessened by <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ArithmeticRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Arithmetic Rewards for Investments</A>, as the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Investments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Investments</A> can be split into several without losing efficiency while <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GeometricRewardsforInvestments.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Geometric Rewards for Investments</A> are increased for the opposite reason.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> choices automatically cause <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tradeoffs.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tradeoffs</A> to exist in games: either between actions or between performing actions or not. They cause <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="StimulatedPlanning.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Stimulated Planning</A> in games and affect <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="CognitiveImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cognitive Immersion</A> by adding additional aspects that have to be considered regarding actions. Being good at correctly judging <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PerceivedChancetoSucceed.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Perceived Chance to Succeed</A> in actions that contain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Rewards</A> is often a part of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="GameMastery.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Game Mastery</A>, and especially being able to do so in games where one is under <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="EmotionalImmersion.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Emotional Immersion</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The presence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="RiskReward.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Risk/Reward</A> in games naturally creates <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>, as players may fail to gain the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> they want. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Reversability.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Reversability</A>, however, has a negative effect on this kind of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A>.</P>
