<H2>Competition</H2>
<I>Competition is the struggle between players or against the game system to achieve a certain goal where the performance of the players can be measured at least relatively.</I>
<P CLASS="text"><A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> can take many forms, with the primary dichotomy being between having to actively engage against other players to win, direct <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A>, or being able to win without interacting directly with other players, indirect <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A>. The first case is the most common and is usually aggressive and destructive (e. g., <I>Chess</I>) but is also often perceived as the most emotionally engaging. The second can more easily allow for slow-paced games and constructive gameplay. It also puts more emphasis on competing against oneself.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text"><B>Example: </B>Many games based on race have indirect <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> between the players to reach a certain position in the game as fast as possible. The performance of the players is measured by timing each player's race.</P>

<H3>Using the pattern</H3>
<P CLASS="text">The easiest form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> is <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A> with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A>, but any situation where players have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IncompatibleGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Incompatible Goals</A>, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ExcludingGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Excluding Goals</A> (possibly through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tiebreakers.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tiebreakers</A>), or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> (especially <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="IndividualRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Individual Rewards</A>), can cause <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A>. Two forms of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> that require <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A> are <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Overcome.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Overcome</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="KingoftheHill.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">King of the Hill</A>. Examples of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> without <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Conflict.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Conflict</A> are all forms of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Race.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Races</A> without <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="InterferableGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Interferable Goals</A> or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="LastManStanding.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Last Man Standing</A> goals where the players are not the cause of each others' demise. In these types of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competitions</A>, the players are not each others <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A>, but the game may provide other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Enemies.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Enemies</A> through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Agents.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Agents</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">Using <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="MutualGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Mutual Goals</A> with <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SharedRewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Shared Rewards</A> in subgoalsof the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> reduces the level of competition between the players, as the players can have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Cooperation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cooperation</A> with other players in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Alliances.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alliances</A>. By encouraging <I>Dynamic</I> <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Alliances.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Alliances</A>, the dynamics of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Cooperation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cooperation</A> usually increase the level of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialInteraction.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Interaction</A> between the players.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">How the <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> ends depends on what criteria the different competitors have. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SymmetricGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Symmetric Goals</A> allow players to judge more easily their chance of winning and are often used to create <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerBalance.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Balance</A> between players. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AsymmetricGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Asymmetric Goals</A> allow different strategies and can create a more varied gameplay and may also promote temporary alliances, although it may be more difficult to balance the game. Further, players may have <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="UnknownGoals.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Unknown Goals,</A> which allows for techniques of masquerading one's intentions.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">If one player is certain to win a <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A>, the motivation for other players to continue competing becomes pointless. In the case of subgoals, this can be a temporary setback, which can be offset by winning other <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competitions</A>, but if the outcome of the overall game becomes apparent, the motivation for continuing to play the game may become pointless.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The final outcome of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> varies as well: the winner may gain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Rewards.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Rewards</A> in the form of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>, information, <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="ImprovedAbilities.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Improved Abilities</A>, or <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialStatuses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Status</A>; the loser may similarly lose <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A>, suffer <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="AbilityLosses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ability Losses</A>, or be excluded from the game through <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="PlayerElimination.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Player Elimination</A>. Exclusion from the game near the end of the game is usually not a problem, but early exclusion may be. Specific examples of more complex forms of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> for subgoals within games include <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Bidding.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Bidding</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Trading.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Trading</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">The use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Agents.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Agents</A> allows players to compete without having to risk the social consequences of losing a game to other players. On the other hand, this means loss of opportunities to gain <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialStatuses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Status</A> by winning the game. The use of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Ghosts.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Ghosts</A> has similar effects on <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> but may still give <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialStatuses.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Status</A>, as the results between different players can be compared.</P>

<H3>Consequences</H3>
<P CLASS="text">Having <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> in a game gives a sense of purpose to playing the game and often creates <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Tension.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Tension</A> during gameplay. If players have chosen to play a competitive game, they have chosen to test their abilities against other players, a computer, or a puzzle. <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> can also motivate <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialInteraction.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Interaction</A> in general, but especially in games where there are dynamics of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> and <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Cooperation.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Cooperation</A> between the players, as is the case in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialDilemmas.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Dilemmas</A> and rivalries in <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="SocialOrganizations.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Social Organizations</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="text"></P>
<P CLASS="text">As <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> makes players want to use their <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Resources.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Resources</A> and abilities as efficiently as possible, the presence of <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Competition.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Competition</A> discourages <A CLASS="pattern" HREF="Experimenting.htm" TARGET="frame_pattern">Experimenting</A>.</P>
